6579a3c0316b8a2a5b0c083b,CryptoInsideEN,"Chainlink Staking Program Quickly Pulls in $600M, Hitting Limit\n\nChainlink, the biggest blockchain data-oracle project, saw a powerful uptake for its expanded crypto-staking program, pulling in over $632 million worth of its LINK tokens and filling up to the limit just six hours after the start of an early-access period, the company said in a press release. The ""V0.2"" community staking mechanism opened for early access from 12 p.m. ET, and within 30 minutes, some 32.8 million LINK had been staked; six hours later, the community pool had hit the new, higher capacity of 40.875 million LINK.\n\nThe price of LINK was up by 12% over the past 24 hours to $16.72, according to CoinDesk data. Overall, the expanded staking pool capacity is 45 million LINK, up from 25 million under v0.1, a figure that includes the community pool allocation as well as a separate node operator pool. According to a Chainlink spokesman, there are currently 1.8 million LINK in the node operator pool, out of a capacity of 4.125 million. Chainlink staking enables node operators - which help engineers fetch external data - and community members to support the performance of oracle services with staked LINK. People can also earn rewards. ""Staking v0.2 introduces important new security features and sets the system up for even further growth in the year to come,"" Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a press release.",2023-12-12T16:45:09.000Z
6579a3c0316b8a2a5b0c083c,CryptoInsideEN,"🪙 Over $600M Locked in Open Dogecoin Futures as DOGE Price Hits Highest Since April\n\nBitcoin's recent rapid rally has revived risk-taking in the crypto market, spurring investors to pour money into non-serious cryptocurrencies like dogecoin (DOGE), which was created as a joke 10 years ago. DOGE, the world's leading meme cryptocurrency, has gained over 10% in the past 24 hours to trade above $0.10 for the first time since April, according to data tracked by TradingView. The prices has gained 27% in seven days, seemingly tracking bitcoin's surge to $44,000 from $38,000.\n\nThe notional open interest – or the dollar value locked in the number of active futures and perpetual futures contracts – tied to DOGE has risen by 58% to $625 million in one week, reaching the highest since Nov. 2, 2022, according to data source CoinGlass. That increase, alongside a rising price, is said to confirm the uptrend. Funding rates on several exchanges have surged to an annualized 50% or more, indicating a steep premium in perpetual futures relative to spot prices, Velo Data data show. Positive rates indicate investor preference for long, or bullish, bets and reflect collective optimism that prices will likely increase. In other words, they behave as leveraged plays on the largest cryptocurrency.",2023-12-08T09:48:04.000Z
6579a3c0316b8a2a5b0c083d,CryptoInsideEN,"Bitcoin Eyes $40K as $1B in BTC Withdrawals Suggests Bullish Mood\n\nThe case for a continued rally in bitcoin (BTC) to $40,000 and higher by the year-end has strengthened, with centralized exchanges recently witnessing a sizeable exodus of coins. The outflow likely represents a bias for a long-term holding strategy, although some of it could have stemmed from Binance's guilty plea. The bias for holding means strong demand and weakening sell-side pressure in the market amid euphoria from an expected launch of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S.\n\nExchange outflows have historically marked local price lows, supporting expectations of a medium-term price rise. BTC traded above the $38,800 mark early Friday, leading to gains in the broader crypto market, with some major tokens jumping as much as 5% in the past 24 hours. ""The Federal Reserve has paused its rate hiking cycle and central banks around the world are following,"" Anthony Rousseau, head of brokerage at TradeStation, told CoinDesk in an email. ""It's plausible to believe we have reached the heights of this tightening cycle. For risk assets to get a sustained bid we will need to see a path forward with lower rates and an end to Quantitative Tightening.""",2023-12-03T05:37:06.000Z
6579a3c0316b8a2a5b0c083e,CryptoInsideEN,"Bitcoin spot ETF anticipation fuels largest crypto fund inflows for two years: CoinShares\n\nCrypto fund inflows at asset managers such as 21Shares, CoinShares, Bitwise, Grayscale and ProShares added $346 million last week, the largest jump since the bull market of late 2021, according to CoinShares’ latest report. Last week's addition nearly doubled the $176 million registered in the prior week, compounding a nine-week consecutive run and bringing year-to-date inflows to over $1.5 billion. The surge was fueled by anticipation of a U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETF, CoinShares.\n\nBitcoin investment products accounted for $312 million of the total inflows last week, while short-sellers ""continue to capitulate,"" Butterfill added, with short bitcoin funds seeing a third week of outflows totaling just under $1 million and AUM falling over 60% since a peak in April. ETPs now account for 18% of total spot bitcoin trading volume, well above average, highlighting their growing popularity among investors seeking exposure to digital assets, Butterfill noted. Ether investment products added $34 million last week to a run totaling over $100 million. The four-week inflow streak has almost fully corrected outflows for the year, marking a decisive turn-around in sentiment, Butterfill said.",2023-11-28T14:06:21.000Z

Recently Islamic Coin has secured $200M from private investments and another $200M from ABO Digital.\n\nThe coin is backed by top names in finance and UAE Royal Family members on Executive Board. In addition, partnerships with SushiSwap and Pyypl will help further expand Islamic Coin's ecosystem, providing liquidity and staking assets, and setting the stage for lucrative token mining opportunities. The coin has the biggest Twitter account among crypto Muslim community with 1.3M followers and the potential audience of over 2 billion holders. Developers believe that if at least 3% of this audience holds ISLM token, the capitalization will be comparable to BTC.

6579a3c0316b8a2a5b0c0841,CryptoInsideEN,"BitGo CEO expects further complications before a Bitcoin ETF can hit market\n\nIn a recent interview with Bloomberg TV, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe expressed a cautious outlook on the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. SEC. Belshe’s optimism regarding the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF was accompanied by a dose of realism, indicating that the path to approval might encounter additional hurdles.\n\nThe key concern highlighted by Belshe revolves around market structure issues, specifically the SEC’s insistence on the separation of exchange and custody roles. This issue has been contentious in various applications, particularly those involving Coinbase custody. Belshe noted that the SEC’s emphasis on market structure is not unprecedented, citing the existing separation of exchanges from custody in other markets like the CFTC market structure and equities markets. He also suggested aligning with this separation model would benefit the crypto market. SEC will demand a complete separation of these functions before approving the applications.",2023-11-21T19:37:41.000Z
6579a3c0316b8a2a5b0c0842,CryptoInsideEN,"Bitcoin price spikes $800 on claims SEC is engaging with exchanges over spot ETFs\n\nThe price of bitcoin spiked by $800 immediately following a report that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been interacting with exchanges in relation to numerous spot bitcoin ETF applications.  ""Hearing chatter SEC’s Trading & Markets engaged with exchanges this week on spot bitcoin ETF 19b-4s, is advising them they'd like the ETFs to do cash creates (vs in-kind), and has asked them to get in amendments in next couple weeks,"" wrote Eric Balchunas.\n\nBalchunas noted that cash creates make sense because they reduce limitations on broker dealers. He said that a few bitcoin ETF applications had planned this already while the remainder had chosen to go for in-kind. ""Anyway, this doesn’t change our 90% odds up or down but is good sign the process marching and SEC has a path [forward] in the plumbing that they are comfortable with,"" he added. The price of bitcoin surged from roughly $36,000 to $36,800 in just minutes following the post before settling down, according to The Block's Price Page.  ""Nothing groundbreaking. Nothing changes.

Bitcoin holdings at the company founded by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, who often tweets his support for the largest cryptocurrency, reached $5.7 billion late on Thursday as the price crossed $37,000 for the first time since May 2022.

The new games will want to do away with technical and financial entry barriers.\n\n➡️ The point is, Dizon argued, that in order for mass adoption to happen, games need to be free to play first.\n\n🟢 He said that,\n\n💬 “There’s an evolution of the business model where the games are free to play, and then at some point along the way while you’re playing, then you’re able to mint an NFT or start earning tokens, but a lot of new games aren’t really starting with requiring NFT ownership at the start.”\n\n📌 Dizon said that there is a wider effort among Web3 game developers to put gameplay first and tokenomics second.\n\n📌 Additionally, there is an issue of speculative Web3 gaming bubbles – and this pivot will be a part of the solution.

Access to US customers is a privilege, not a right.”\n\n🟥 Romero added that the CFTC’s case against former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and the crypto exchange was just the beginning, and that her Commission would continue to “aggressively go after crypto platforms operating in U.S. markets that seek to evade the CFTC’s customer protection regime.”\n\n➡️ Earlier this week, Zhao agreed to pay $50 million in fines after pleading guilty to violating money laundering rules.

The decision to withdraw from Cyprus was explained as a strategic move to concentrate on fewer regulated entities in the EU, with a focus on France, Italy, and Spain, in anticipation of the European Union’s crypto asset regulations rollout.\n\n🔍 Moreover, regulators in Australia revoked the financial services license of Binance’s derivatives business. In the Philippines, the securities regulator initiated the process of blocking Binance last week.\n\n➗➗➗➗➗➗➗\n\n🚀The Binance spokesperson emphasized on Thursday that the crypto exchange would continue to work with regulators “to provide world-class services and offerings in the Middle East and beyond.”",2023-12-09T16:03:03.000Z
