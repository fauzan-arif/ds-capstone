The ""V0.2"" community staking mechanism opened for early access from 12 p.m. ET, and within 30 minutes, some 32.8 million LINK had been staked; six hours later, the community pool had hit the new, higher capacity of 40.875 million LINK.\n\nThe price of LINK was up by 12% over the past 24 hours to $16.72, according to CoinDesk data. Overall, the expanded staking pool capacity is 45 million LINK, up from 25 million under v0.1, a figure that includes the community pool allocation as well as a separate node operator pool. According to a Chainlink spokesman, there are currently 1.8 million LINK in the node operator pool, out of a capacity of 4.125 million. Chainlink staking enables node operators - which help engineers fetch external data - and community members to support the performance of oracle services with staked LINK. People can also earn rewards. ""Staking v0.2 introduces important new security features and sets the system up for even further growth in the year to come,"" Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a press release.",2023-12-12T16:45:09.000Z

That increase, alongside a rising price, is said to confirm the uptrend. Funding rates on several exchanges have surged to an annualized 50% or more, indicating a steep premium in perpetual futures relative to spot prices, Velo Data data show.

The outflow likely represents a bias for a long-term holding strategy, although some of it could have stemmed from Binance's guilty plea.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands at $27,500 recently, flat over the past 24 hours, but still outperforming the wider crypto market. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which features a broad basket of digital assets, was down 0.3%, while ether (ETH) slid 1.8% over the same period.\n\n“In the near term, I expect the market to sell into this rally,” John Glover, chief investment officer of Ledn, told CoinDesk in an email. “In the absence of new capital flowing into digital assets, I believe that this is what this rally will be: short-lived.” Glover expects a more durable appreciation will materialize later this year and early next year as bitcoin appears to be finished with its corrective move. “I do believe that BTC prices will be higher in three months than they are today as technically we’ve completed the sell off and I now look for a sustained rally into Q2 2024,"" he said. Investment research firm ByteTree upgraded its BTC market signal from neutral to bull in a report on Thursday.

Rio de Janeiro, Goiás and Paraná will be the first states to issue identification documents on-chain through a private blockchain developed by Serpro, Brazil’s national data processing service. The entire country should be able to issue identity documents through blockchain technology by Nov. 6, reads a decree on Sept. 25.\n\nAccording to Alexandre Amorim, president of Serpro, the immutability and decentralization of blockchain made it an ideal technology for the country’s digital identification project. As per the local government, the national ID project is crucial in targeting organized crime, allowing government sectors to work together, offering a simpler way to access services and streamlining administrative records. The city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, recently disclosed a similar initiative, allowing residents to access identity documents via a digital wallet.

This should produce some interesting market dynamics.\n🔆 It is expected (though this should not be taken as a prediction of future performance) that Dublr will transition from minting new coins on the mint price curve to trading with an effectively fixed supply, once sufficient supply has been created and mint price becomes exorbitant.\n🔆 The DUBLR token utilizes a new ultra-secure ERC20 implementation, and has passed security audits by two separate auditing companies (Omniscia and SolidProof)\n\nRead the Dublr whitepaper here:\n👉🏻 https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dublr/dublr/raw/main/whitepaper.pdf\n\nTo buy/sell DUBLR tokens:\n1️⃣ Buy MATIC tokens on an exchange, and transfer via Polygon network to a private wallet (e.g. MetaMask)\n2️⃣ Browse to the Dublr dapp: https://dublr.github.io/\n3️⃣ Connect the dapp to your wallet, using the blue button near the top\n4️⃣ Follow the instructions on the ""Buy"" and ""Sell"" tabs\n\nNote that in order to make Dublr safe for use, Dublr goes out of its way to not be classified as a security by US SEC laws, which requires at least the following:\n✅ The creator of Dublr minted no tokens for themself (initial supply: 0). All supply will be community-owned. This is unprecedented in the history of fungible tokens.\n✅ No promise of profits is given (or can be given) to purchasers of DUBLR tokens, since price is entirely defined by supply vs. demand.\n✅ In particular, the name ""Dublr"" refers only to the growth of the mint price, not to the price at which DUBLR tokens may be sold for (the mint price curve sets only an upper bound on price growth, not a lower bound).\n✅ Dublr is launched on the Polygon network, not Ethereum mainnet, since the US SEC Chairman recently declared the entire Ethereum ecosystem to be a security, falling under US jurisdiction.",2022-11-10T02:03:22.000Z

6579c6349c8c4517bf26e643,65784f742d93a25348d0ab8b,cryptsignaltoday,"#BTC #Bitcoin\n\nBTC is now below its 1W MA200 for the first time since the Mar 2020 COVID crash. As I've mentioned numerous times, that has been the trend-line that marked the bottoms on both previous BTC Bear Cycles (all candles closed above).\n\nOn this analysis, I am extending analysis on the Support by adding a variety of elements:\n\n1) The Weekly MA300, which was the level that got hit, supported the price and initiated the rally on the March 2020 COVID crash.\n2) The Mayer MA, which fits perfectly on this Support Zone charting I want to make clear with the MA200 and MA300.\n3) Mapping of all previous Cycles\n4) The Halvings\n\n\nWeekly MA300 \nFirst, it is critical to acknowledge where the Weekly MA300 is. On this INDEX BTC chart, it sits around 16590. That is way below the Top of the previous Bear Cycle (19800), which if broken it will be the first time in history. If the current Weekl candle closes considerably below the Weekly MA200, a trader should acknowledge that as a possibility. Notice however that this is the top of the Mayer MA Support Band (Blue zone), which was last hit on the Aug 2015 candle.\n\n\n The Halvings can time the Bottoms \nThe good news come when we incorporate the Halvings on the chart. As you see, the previous Bear Cycle bottoms have been 882 and 791 days after the previous Halving for the December 2018 and the January 2015 bottoms respectively. Or alternatively 518 and 539 days before the next Halving. Right now that creates a potential Bottom Phase within the July 04 and October 03 2022 1W candles.\n\n\nWeekly MA50/MA100 Cross\n \nOn top of that, there is a pattern that when formed, it basically confirms that the Cycle's Bottom has been priced. That is the Weekly MA50/MA100 Cross (when the Weekly MA50 crosses below the Weekly MA100 . I've analyzed that before but it fits very well on the current idea. If the MA50 and MA100 don't diverge from their current course, the Cross is projected to take place within the Bottom Phase as illustrated by the Halvings.\n\n\nCycle Mapping\n\nEven though the current Cycle has been an odd one, especially when thinking about its top, which not only it didn't make a blow-off top above the upper Mayer MA Zone (red zone) but also made a slightly higher top in Nov, it hasn't diverged much from the previous ones. As you see if we divide the Bear Cycles into phases, they all tend to follow the same pattern:\n\na) Blue Triangle = Blow-off phase but with price still supported by the wekly MA50 \nb) Green Rectangle = Price consolidating, below the Weekly MA50 but supported by the Weekly MA100.\nc) Orange Channel Down = Final sell-off/ price collapsing below the Weekly MA100 but finds support and contained above the Weekly MA200.\n\nWe are currently on Phase C. Whether or not BTC hits the 1W MA300 now or in a later stage of the new Bull Cycle, as it did on both previous Cycles (see red circles), that remains to be seen.\n\nSo bottom is around 16K -18k but MA 50 need to cross Ma 100 for confirmation. personally i am loading spot positions along with 50% positions in BUSD for fuckery that may come due to inflation rising higher and higher",2022-06-20T14:33:26.000Z

It is worth noting that the previous ATH was set in November 2021, when the price of BTC was 60% higher than the current price.\n\nWhile Bitcoin does not support smart contracts, developers are focusing on using the base layer as a settlement layer. They are pushing complex use cases to higher layers to improve functionality without compromising scalability or security. This has led to the emergence of ""locked coins"" on the Bitcoin blockchain. Here are the top 7 protocols by TVL (Total Value Locked) on Bitcoin:\n\n🔹 The Lightning Network is a second-layer scaling solution for Bitcoin, designed to enhance scalability and enable faster, cost-effective transactions through off-chain payment channels.\n\n🔹 THORChain is a decentralized liquidity protocol that facilitates cross-chain token swaps, allowing users to trade assets across different blockchains in a trustless manner.\n\n🔹 BiFi is a web3 derivatives protocol that provides decentralized cross-chain liquidity for staked assets.\n\n🔹 Maya Protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol for exchanging assets across blockchains.\n\n🔹 HOPE Collateral is distributed stablecoin  backed by crypto-native reserves.\n\n🔹 BoringDAO is an inter-blockchain hub that enables assets to be transferred across different chains, in a cost-efficient and timely manner.\n\n🔹 Mento is a decentralized and transparent protocol that enables the creation of stable value digital assets.\n\n👉 https://cryptorank.io/price/bitcoin",2023-12-07T13:36:15.000Z

The new games will want to do away with technical and financial entry barriers.\n\n➡️ The point is, Dizon argued, that in order for mass adoption to happen, games need to be free to play first.\n\n🟢 He said that,\n\n💬 “There’s an evolution of the business model where the games are free to play, and then at some point along the way while you’re playing, then you’re able to mint an NFT or start earning tokens, but a lot of new games aren’t really starting with requiring NFT ownership at the start.”\n\n📌 Dizon said that there is a wider effort among Web3 game developers to put gameplay first and tokenomics second.\n\n📌 Additionally, there is an issue of speculative Web3 gaming bubbles – and this pivot will be a part of the solution. Per Dizon, developers are focusing more on making games that players will continue playing, reinvesting money in the game, thus preventing “the in-game economy from becoming a cash-generating machine.”",2023-11-20T14:01:48.000Z

Decentralized exchange Aerodrome Finance holds the top spot with a TVL of $97.83 million, while the decentralized social media app Friendtech ranks second with a TVL of $36.53 million. Aerodrome Finance, launched on August 28, allows users to deposit liquidity to earn its native AERO tokens and offers other features. Although it had a slow start, Aerodrome's TVL skyrocketed on August 31, with a massive $150 million pouring in on that day alone. \n\n🔴 However, the project's TVL has since decreased by approximately 51% as the initial hype subsided. Friendtech, launched on August 11, enables users to tokenize their social networks through the buying and selling of ""Keys."" Despite facing challenges in late August, the platform experienced a dramatic surge in September.",2023-09-24T13:00:00.000Z

This news comes shortly after the company made significant workforce reductions, CoinDesk reported on Tuesday, noting that the firm had 70 full-time employees and contractors as of August 14.\n\n🔔 Prime Trust's current headcount is unknown, but it is likely no more than the 70 people reported last month. The new round of layoffs therefore means that only a handful of people are left on Prime Trust’s payroll to manage the bankruptcy process. Prime Trust filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on August 14, saying at the time that it had liabilities of $100 million to $500 million from 25,000 and 50,000 creditors. The bankruptcy filing was made after allegations from Nevada regulators that the firm couldn't meet customer withdrawal requests.\n\n➡️ At the time, the problems for Prime Trust were said to have begun when the company reintroduced ""legacy wallets"" to customers, only to find out that it couldn't access them, along with the cryptocurrencies they held. To meet withdrawal demands in the face of the situation, Prime Trust resorted to using customer funds to buy crypto, which could then be withdrawn.",2023-09-21T12:00:46.000Z

In a court filing released Thursday, SEC has targeted BinanceUS's use of Ceffu, a custody service provided by Binance Holdings Ltd, the international arm of the Binance empire.  \n\n🔔 U.S. regulators are concerned that this use of Ceffu custody may breach a previous agreement designed to prevent assets from being moved overseas.

The legislation, if passed, would amend sections of Texas’ utilities and tax code to add restrictions for crypto mining facilities.\n\n🤩The campaign, named “Don’t Mess With Texas Innovation” — a play on the state’s anti-littering slogan, which has been used by many lawmakers to describe government overreach — claimed many aspects of the mining bill were antithetical to free market principles. Currently, some crypto mining firms are allowed to participate in a program organized by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which compensates them for adjusting their load on the state’s power grid during periods of high demand.\n\n👉“We need to send a strong message to policymakers that the people do not want protectionist policies that push innovation out of the market,” said Chamber of Digital Commerce founder and CEO Perianne Boring. “At a time when folks here are concerned with the economy, jobs, and a reliable energy grid headed into summer, this bill is the wrong proposal at the wrong time.”\n\n👋Operations concerning Texas’ power grid have been under increased scrutiny from federal and state lawmakers and regulators since a massive winter storm in February 2021 left millions of residents without power — as well as running water — for days. Such conditions have also contributed to damage to certain miners due to burst water pipes.\n\nMany experts said that it was unlikely crypto firms contributed to the energy crisis in Texas in 2021 due to them temporarily shutting down or scaling back operations as part of the ERCOT program.",2023-04-10T20:00:00.000Z

According to CertiK, the low amount of losses may be linked to events happening off-chain that had an impact on the crypto industry as a whole, such as the issues with Silvergate Bank and the depegging of USD Coin at the height of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse.\n\nOut of the funds stolen within the quarter, over $31 million was lost to 90 exit scams, while more than $222 million was lost in 52 flash loan and oracle manipulation exploits. Regarding incidents and the amount lost per blockchain, CertiK highlighted that BNB Chain had 139 incidents, the greatest number for the quarter. Meanwhile, despite having fewer incidents, Ethereum had $221 million in losses, the most lost in Q1 2023.\n\n➡️Despite being much lower than Q1 2022 and Q4 2022, the first quarter of 2023 was still met with hundreds of millions lost, with 60% coming from the recent Euler Finance hack. On March 13, the protocol was hacked through a flash loan exploit, leading to losses of over $195 million. \n\n✔️While the amount lost to hacking looks enormous at a glance, a huge chunk of the funds was recovered through negotiations with hackers. On April 4, Euler Finance announced that it was able to recover around 90% of the lost funds after almost a month of back-and-forth negotiations with the hacker.\n\n😶This trend has been witnessed in the space more frequently with other hacks following Euler’s example. On April 6, lending protocol Sentiment also recovered around $870,000 after giving a bounty of $95,000 to those responsible for taking almost a million dollars from the platform.",2023-04-07T19:00:01.000Z

However, the ban has not deterred its users from finding a workaround by creating deepfakes of Xi, which are manipulated digital representations produced by sophisticated machine-learning techniques.\n\n👉Last week, Midjourney took action to prevent the proliferation of deepfakes on its platform by disabling access to its free trial version.

Or you can use / blend with two existing photos.” Another user said there was the alternative of using MidJourney v5’s blend function between two images but expressed fear of it being policed eventually.\n\n🧑💁Critics, like Sarah McLaughlin, senior scholar at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), have argued that the ban constitutes a form of censorship, undermining the fundamental principles of free speech and expression.\n\nIn messages exchanged on the chat service Discord last autumn, Midjourney’s founder and CEO, David Holz, revealed that the firm had received complaints from local users about “various😆 topics in different countries,“ prompting them to block numerous related words.

On March 17, nearly 5,000 people deposited more than 536 ETH using the zkSync bridge, and almost 3,000 users deposited over 234 ETH using the StarkNet bridge.\n\n😵Although zkSync neither has a native token nor announced any airdrop, the enthusiasm around the Arbitrum airdrop has led many proponents to believe they would be rewarded in the near future.\n\nThe hype around the airdrops comes amid multiple fake and scam airdrops being attempted by scammers using Arbitrum 😅branding.\n\n🖐A crypto airdrop is a promotional tool for crypto projects to generate hype around the project. The crypto projects behind these airdrops often directly deposit digital tokens into the wallets of active blockchain community members as a gift. Many of these airdrops have specific preset eligibility criteria that reward users for spreading awareness around the project.\n\nAirdrops have been popular since the early stages of the crypto ecosystem, with the first airdrop coming in 2014. Projects have relaxed marketing strategies in recent times owing to regulatory scrutiny.🤪",2023-03-20T18:30:00.000Z

Kraken agreed to pay a $30 million fine and halt its staking program. The move was widely criticized by the American crypto community and even the SEC’s acting commissioner.\n\nIn his analysis for Cointelegraph, J.W. Verret, an associate professor at the George Mason Law School, warned about the SEC’s intention to use its Kraken playbook against staking protocols in general:\n\n“It’s becoming clear from a pattern across financial regulators and the White House that the subtext in the administration’s policy toward crypto is that it should be choked off.”\n\nIn February, South Korea’s Financial Services Commission established guidance that specifies which types of digital assets will be considered and regulated as securities in the country. The law considers securities as financial investments where investors are not required to make additional payments after their original investment.",2023-02-15T17:00:38.000Z

With a trading volume of over $40 billion in the past few days, the market is buzzing with activity, and many investors are wondering what this could mean for the future of Bitcoin. \n\nIn this update, we will explore the impact of this surge in trading volume on the price of Bitcoin and analyze the role played by whales in the current market scenario. \n\nDespite concerns among some crypto traders about potential regulatory shocks in the near future, a group of high-profile investors remains unfazed. Following the temporary suspension of US Dollar deposits and withdrawals by Binance, a crisis scenario could arise if no US banks step up to offer support. \n\nWhile there may be more clarity on the situation next week, the recent $30 million settlement between Kraken and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) resulted in a sudden drop in market prices.\nFollowing the settlement, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong issued a warning that the SEC could potentially ban crypto staking altogether. Against this backdrop, recent remarks from SEC chair Gary Gensler suggest that crypto companies will be required to provide full disclosures, further supporting the possibility of such actions being taken in the future.",2023-02-12T10:30:00.000Z

Per Seoul Kyungjae, the case was heard at the Busan High Court (Ulsan Tribunal) on November 12. The scammer, unnamed for legal reasons, was originally sentenced to serve eight years by an Ulsan-based district court. But the High Court upheld the scammer’s guilty verdict – and increased the jail term after hearing additional evidence from prosecutors.\n\n♾ The court heard that the individual, named as A in the national media, told victims that they could use “crypto market manipulation” methods to make “x50 profits” on their initial stakes. The court heard that the bogus crypto exchange was operational from March to August 2019. Prosecutors said that A had “advertised” the platform on social media channels. The scammer raised almost $1 million from “about 90 victims,” the court heard.\n\n⚠️ A claimed that the platform made use of a sophisticated piece of software “developed in-house” that manipulated crypto prices.

A new research report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (FRBC) has identified several key factors and catalysts that accelerated last year’s crypto crisis.\n\n👉The report identified that withdrawals by crypto whales and large account holders on centralized exchanges, including some key institutional accounts, created a liquidity crisis that eventually led to the bank run.\n\n🙊The first crisis came from the Terra collapse, spurring customer outflows for many crypto lenders with exposure to the Terra ecosystem. Celsius and Voyager Digital saw outflows of 20% and 14% of their customer funds, respectively, in the 11 days after the collapse. Celsius had also invested nearly a billion dollars in Terra’s failed algorithmic stablecoin.\n\n🙃The second major crisis, catalyzed by high customer outflows, came from Three Arrows Capital’s (3AC) downfall in July 2022. Celsius and Voyager Digital saw another round of outflows of 10% and 39%, respectively, due to their exposure to the bankrupt 3AC.\n\n😱3AC became a major source of contagion in the crypto industry as multiple firms had lent billions in crypto assets to the hedge fund, resulting in a major crisis after its failure. Genesis Capital provided 3AC with loans totaling around $2.4 billion; BlockFi provided $1 billion; Voyager Digital provided $350 million and 15,250 Bitcoin, worth approximately $328 million in July 2022; and Celsius provided around $75 million.",2023-05-16T19:00:01.000Z

The firm added that Trezor had not found any evidence of a database breach.\n\nAccording to online reports, the latest phishing attack against Trezor customers was launched on Feb. 27, with users being directed to a domain asking to enter their recovery seed. The domain provides a perfectly-made fake Trezor website that prompts users to start securing their wallets by clicking the “Start” button.\n\nAfter clicking the “Start” button, users will be asked to provide the recovery phrase for their cryptocurrency wallet.\n\n💣The wallet’s recovery phrase, or private keys, is the most important part of self-custody by keeping your crypto on a software or hardware noncustodial wallet. The safety of the recovery phrase is more important than keeping the hardware wallet safe. Once the private keys are stolen, it means that crypto holdings no longer belong to their original owner.",2023-03-02T18:30:00.000Z

Sitharaman has historically supported working with other jurisdictions to develop crypto regulations.

At $1,649, it has barely changed after a week and is up by 6% in the last 30 days, with the biggest altcoin also rising by 38% since the start of the year.\n\n📈While ETH is down today, there are various good reasons to expect it to rally soon. Because not only does it continue to be the biggest layer-one network by total value locked in and apps, but Coinbase has just announced its own layer-two sidechain for Ethereum, something which will undoubtedly boost usage of the latter.\nETH's chart reveals that, despite bullish news, the altcoin is down probably because it was due a fall, as suggested by its technical indicators. For example, its relative strength index (purple) had spent much of January above 70, and have now begun slipping down this month, while falling close to 50 in the past few days.\n\nAt the same time, ETH's 30-day moving (red) has peaked in relation to its 200-day average (blue).

But why? 🤔Well, because much like high-end property and think of a CryptoPunk as a high-end property in London or New York🌃 or Hong Kong or wherever it is, when the economy starts booming and people have more money, they tend to buy expensive high-end property.”\n\n“And it tends to outperform the rest of the market. And I think the same thing will happen in ETH economy,” he added.\n\nHe highlighted that major collections such as CryptoPunks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) have become status symbols in the crypto community, much like owning a luxury house, car, or item from a famous brand that offers access to exclusive clubs or what he dubbed as “mini network-states.”\n\nHe saidthat NFTs serve as a “way of owning property in the ETH economy,” adding:\n\n“Humans are ridiculous and we love to socially signal stuff.”\n\nLooking back, the former hedge fund manager said NFTs started to draw his attention in 2022 as he started to “understand the power of what they are and what they can do,” such as being able to transfer “value” via blockchains and automated smart contracts.\n\nHe also pointed to NFTs’ uses in the resolution of contracts, noting that blockchain-based ledgers can offer verifiable transparency on what has been agreed between people, while smart contracts can essentially do away with unnecessary third parties.",2023-02-21T17:00:19.000Z

Last week, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a Twitter post that the company is exploring other issuers and non-USD based stablecoins.\n\nHowever, experts have claimed that such a pivot could prove to be difficult, and the stablecoin might hardly find any significant adoption. \n\nFor instance, the largest non-dollar fiat-backed stablecoin is currently Euro Tether (EURT), which has a market capitalization of $220 million. In comparison, Tether (USDT), which is dollar-pegged, has a market cap of over $70 billion. \n\n“One of the many reasons it has taken so long for non-USD stablecoins to become prevalent is regulations,” said Kevin Zhang, cofounder of DFX Finance, a decentralized finance protocol for non-U.S. dollar stablecoins, adding:\n\n“Stablecoin issuers are looking for ways to properly get regulated without making numerous assumptions and spending insane amounts of money on lawyers to provide opinions.”\n\nZhang, however, noted that the recent hostile attitude by U.S. regulators creates an opportunity for non-USD stablecoins. “Binance being the size that they are and having the reach that they have will always be a relevant player in the stablecoin space. The denomination of trading pairs in certain stablecoins creates huge network effects,” he added.\n\nLast week, the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) ordered Paxos, a crypto firm that issues Binance’s stablecoin Binance USD (BUSD), to stop minting BUSD. Subsequently, it was revealed that the SEC plans to sue the company over its BUSD issuance. The agency argued that BUSD is considered an unregistered security.\n\nBinance Losing Foot in the U.S.\n\nAside from the saga around its stablecoin, Binance has been facing increasing difficulty in the U.S. on a number of other fronts, too. Last month, the exchange's banking partner Signature Bank raised transaction minimums for dollar transfers, announcing that it would only process trades by users with USD bank accounts over $100,000. \n\nThe exchange also announced that it is temporarily suspending U.S. dollar withdrawals and deposits for international customers earlier this month.\n\nAnd prior to that, US authorities sent subpoenas to American hedge funds and market-making companies dealing with Binance, asking for records of their communications with the exchange.",2023-02-20T11:00:37.000Z

This price marks a 9% drop in the past week and a 6.5% decline in the last 30 days, as LUNC teeters between recovery and relapse. \n\nHowever, today's movements have enabled LUNC to reclaim its $1 billion market cap, which it had lost over the weekend. And with its 24-hour trading volume also returning to $100 million, there's enough liquidity in its market to feed further rises in the near future.\nLUNC's indicators suggest that it could be recovering from its recent losses, with both main indicators signalling potential rallies. Its relative strength index (purple) has risen from 20 to 50 in the past few days, meaning that buying momentum could increase and push its price further.\n\nAt the same time, LUNC's 30-day moving average (red) has turned upwards again after falling below its 200-day average (blue). Again, this suggests that a positive movement may be incoming.\nLUNC's rise to day comes as its trading volume rises from a low of $47 million over the weekend to over $100 million yesterday. This is another sign that a rally could be coming, and that now may be a good time to buy.\n\nIn terms of levels, it will be interesting to see if LUNC can break through the $0.00017 resistance level. If it can, then a more prolonged rally may be possible.\n\nAs far as fundamentals go, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic if you're a LUNC holder. In particular, the now-accepted proposal to re-peg USTC is very bullish for the altcoin, since re-peg its sister stablecoin would necessitate a large-scale burn of LUNC tokens. \n\nAs its authors write, the accepted proposal entails ""designing a more efficient system for LUNC and USTC that can burn more than the tax rate can."" As such, the medium-to-long term will likely mean that LUNC's burn total -- which is currently at 39 billion -- will rise substantially.",2023-02-15T12:00:20.000Z

The UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak highlighted that making the UK crypto hub is now on his agenda: “It's my ambition to make the U.K a global hub for crypto-asset technology”.\n\nPrevious editions of Blockchain Economy Summits were sponsored and attended by major players such as Crypto com, Gate io, Kucoin, BitMEX, Kraken, MicroStrategy, Microsoft, Amazon, Polygon, Meta and others. After 3 years of their continuous partnerships with the Blockchain Economy Summit, this year OKX announced its Exclusive Title Sponsorship for all Blockchain Economy Events of 2023, including the upcoming London Summit. It is important to note that OKX was the first transparent cryptocurrency exchange to release the proof of their reserves after the FTX collapse. The Exchange is now available in more than 192 countries.  \n\nThis highly anticipated Blockchain Event will be hosted by BBC, Sky and Bloomberg’s Financial Commentator Victoria Scholar. Key aspects of industry such as: Investing in Cryptocurrencies; Trading techniques in bear markets; De-Fi; Crypto Exchanges and regulations to protect user funds; Regulation of virtual assets/cryptocurrencies worldwide and in UK; Bitcoin; Blockchain Gaming; Web 3; Tokenization; Institutional Adoption of Blockchain technologies; Importance of NFTs; The New Reality with Metaverse; AI will be discussed on the Conference stage for 2 days. \n\nAlongside the conference, the event also offers extensive networking opportunities, 1:1 meetings with institutionalized organizations; VIP meetings and NFT Gallery where you can enjoy all the beauty of contemporary digital arts.",2023-02-14T13:00:24.000Z

What's the secret behind the rapid token's value growth during such a depressive period of bear market rally?\n\nThe secret of this growth partly lies in rumors that Sundae senators have established an accumulation fund where about 30% of the token's sales profit goes.\n\nThe fund plans to invest in various sources of income, such as trust funds, media, online schools, IT companies, digital agencies, and even immortal canvases by world-famous authors.\n\nThe project has all chances to become revolutionary, as evidenced by its listing on major exchanges like MEXC and Bitget, the participation of bloggers with a million-strong audience and funds that previously invested in the current market ""monsters.""\n\nOne of the Odyssey co-founders explains: ""Sundae means 'ice cream dessert.' Yesterday, the token cost only $0.25, less than ice cream. Today it's already $4, and tomorrow it could be worth thousands. Can you buy your secure future at the price of an ice cream? A foolish question, of course, you can!""",2023-11-08T15:59:09.000Z

The company’s suite of GPT services has been outright banned in Italy pending further information about its intent and ability to comply with GDPR, with similar actions pending in Ireland, France and Germany.\n\nAccording to the European Union (EU) data watchdog, OpenAI currently finds itself between a European rock and a U.S. hard place, legally speaking. As regulators in the EU look to crack down, U.S. lawmakers could be eyeing the European prescription as a possible local template:👇\n\n“The European approach is connected with the purpose for which you use the data. So when you change the purpose for which the data is used, and especially if you do it against the information that you provide people with, you are in breach of law.”\n\n😜However, some experts believe it will be next to impossible for developers to bring GPT🏙 and similar large language AI models (LLMs) in line with GDPR. One reason for this is that the data they’re trained on is often conflated, thus making individual data points inseparable from one another.",2023-04-25T19:30:00.000Z

However, it has had a rough start, with billions in losses.\n\n🤝Nonetheless, a new report from The Wall Street Journal says that Meta’s programmers working on the company’s virtual reality suite can earn total compensation from “$600,000 to packages approaching $1 million.”\n\nThe report says the information on metaverse developer salaries at Meta came from anonymous “people familiar with the matter.”\n\nAccording to reports from the beginning of the year, the company’s metaverse-building division, Reality Labs, lost $13.7 billion over the course of 2022. It marked the division’s largest yearly losses recorded.\n\n⭐️However, Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s co-founder and CEO, has been on record saying the company doesn’t have any plans to change its long-term vision for the metaverse. In fact, at the beginning of February 2023, Meta was given approval by a judge in the United States to go forward with acquiring a virtual reality company.\n\nPrior to that ruling, Meta was served with a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission against Meta and Zuckerberg as an attempt to block “its ultimate goal of owning the entire ‘metaverse.’”😓\n\nRecently, two U.S. senators released a letter addressed to Zuckerberg urging the Meta CEO not to allow teenagers access to the metaverse platform Horizon Worlds. They cited “serious risks” and called it a “digital space rife with potential harms.”\n\n🤌On March 13, the head of commerce and financial technologies at Meta tweeted that the company was slowly stopping its support for nonfungible tokens on Facebook and Instagram for the time being.

The move runs parallel to establishing the National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) of El Salvador, also known as “the Bitcoin office.“\n\nWhen legalizing Bitcoin on Sept. 7, 2021, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele saw the technology as a means to counter hyperinflation and dependence on the U.S. dollar.

This is particularly true when it comes to artists and creators using Web3 tools to enhance their work. \n\nHowever, new data from eBit Labs and LiveArt marketplace reveals that the loss of creator royalties over the past year in the NFT space could be higher than estimated.🌿\n\nAccording to the data, after the emergence of the Blur marketplace in October 2022, two of the leading NFT collections - Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) - experienced shortcomings in royalties of around $20 million alone\n\n👉The new data involving BAYC and MAYC shortcomings then points to previous estimates of $35 million in royalty shortcomings likely being too small.\n\nCreator royalties have been a big topic of discussion in the NFT space. After briefly halting creator royalties and then receiving severe community backlash, the OpenSea marketplace said it would enforce creator royalties on all listed collections. 🤟\n\n🤪Back in November 2022, the founders of BAYC proposed a new model for NFT creator royalties, which would keep NFT transfers between wallets free.\n\nBack in September of 2022, MagicEden, another prominent NFT marketplace, defended its own NFT royalty enforcement tool. The tool gives creators the ability to flag an NFT or blur the image if the listing or trade bypasses royalty rules. \n\n🧐Nonetheless, Boris Pevzner, the co-founder and CEO of LiveArt, said that despite the Web3 ecosystem touting itself as a “creator-centric space,” the new data shows reality falling short of this promise.\n\n“The shortfall in royalties clearly indicates that the current system is not working as it should.”",2023-03-29T19:00:01.000Z

As for a reason for the jump, the report points to a correlation with the overall recovery of NFT marketplace trading volume, which hit $1.89 billion in February.\n\nThe six marketplaces included in the report were Magic Eden, OpenSea, Blur, X2Y2, CryptoPunks and LooksRare.

MakerDAO currently has over $3.1 billion worth of USDC in collateral backing DAI.\n\n☝️Firstly, Maker proposes reducing the debt ceiling of UNIV2USDCETH-A, UNIV2DAIUSDC-A, GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A and GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A liquidity provider collaterals to 0 DAI. Next, Maker wants to reduce the daily minting limits of its USDC peg stability module from 950 million DAI to 250 million DAI, and increase the fee from 0% to 1% to prevent “excessive dumping of USDC.“ Another stablecoin module, GUSD, will also see its daily minting limit reduced from 50 million DAI to 10 million DAI if the proposal passes.\n\nMaker also wants to eliminate exposure to decentralized finance protocols Curve Finance and Aave entirely. According to Maker, Curve “uses a fixed $1 price for USDC,“ which “presents a risk of bad debt accrual and potentially bank runs with cascading market insolvency if the market price of USDC falls significantly below the current collateral factor.“ While Aave doesn’t possess such risks, Maker nevertheless stated that its “overall risk-reward of depositing funds into the D3M are not favorable under current conditions.“\n\n👉Finally, Maker proposes increasing the protocol’s debt ceiling for the Paxos Dollar (USDP) stablecoin issued by the Paxos Trust Company from 450 million DAI to 1 billion.

If it is passed there as well, the final step would be for it to be signed into law by Governor Greg Gianforte, who could also choose to veto the bill.\n\nThe bill outlined that Montana wants to “protect the right to mine” crypto and “create legal certainty” for miners as mining “provides positive economic value” and could potentially “stabilize the grid and provide revenue for infrastructure upgrades.”\n\nThe bill was written with the help of the Satoshi Action Fund, a pro-Bitcoin lobbying group.\n\nDennis Porter, CEO of the advocacy body, told Cointelegraph in a January interview that leaders in Montana have used zoning laws to attempt to push miners out and have considered imposing higher electricity rates on miner operations.\n\nIn April 2019, Missoula County in Montana passed rules that required miners to operate only in light and heavy industrial districts and required miners to exclusively use renewable energy.

The funding will be used to accelerate adoption and expansion of Addressable’s best-in-class solution, including support for additional blockchains and social media integrations.\n\n“Marketing is all about knowing your audience, but since crypto wallets are anonymized by design, Web3 marketers rarely know their audience’s age, country or purchasing history,” says Dr. Asaf Nadler, co-founder and chief scientist at Addressable. “In the face of anonymity, our solution allows Web3 marketers to associate anonymous blockchain audiences with social media activity, ultimately addressing the most significant barrier to Web3 growth today.” \n\nAddressable’s SaaS solution provides Web3 marketing teams with a powerful platform to launch campaigns and more effectively target new audiences by matching blockchain activity with social profiles. This precise targeting reduces cost-of-acquisition dramatically compared to the broad targeting of existing web2 tools. Leading Web3 companies like Polygon, Bancor, Immutable, and Kryptomon are already using Addressable’s technology to acquire new users in an era when traditional Web2 marketing campaigns are no longer effective.  \n\n“In the Web3 era, the key barrier to growth is the inability of marketers to deliver their messages to their targeted audiences, simply because they don’t know much about them”, says Leon Stern, director of growth at Polygon - an Addressable customer. “Most users aren’t attentive on Discord - they’re on social media, and you need to effectively get their attention there. This is where the value of Addressable lies.” \n\nAddressable was founded by Tomer Sharoni, Tomer Shlomo and Dr. Asaf Nadler, data analytics veterans with more than 20 publications on blockchain, machine learning and big data.\n\n“We are witnessing an increasing number of Web3 companies investing in meaningful and sustainable user growth through social media, where almost all users spend their time,” says Tomer Sharoni, Addressable’s CEO. “Our unique ability to pinpoint Web3 audiences on social media is the missing piece for mass adoption of Web3. In today’s blockchain ecosystem, we’re the only Web3 marketing SaaS platform addressing user acquisition at scale.” \n\n""Effective user acquisition became the major concern for Web3 businesses over the turbulent past year"", said Richard Muirhead, Chairman and Managing Partner at Fabric Ventures.

China has rolled out its central bank digital currency (CBDC) to several cities and made it available for use at the Winter Olympics.\n\nMany other central banks, including the Bank of England, are considering how to roll out a CDBC, while Nigeria’s CBDC has had poor uptake so far. India has already launched a pilot scheme, while Mexico has confirmed the launch of a digital peso.\n\nHowever, Tony Yates, former senior adviser to the Bank of England, advises against CBDCs in a recently published opinion piece for the Financial Times. According to Yates, “The huge undertaking of digital currencies is not worth the costs and risks.”\n\nCBDCs are already in place in most countries as most countries already have digital versions of cash, coins and notes. Yates, therefore, questions the motivations behind global rollouts of CBDCs, calling them “suspect.”\n\nCBDCs could be a way of quashing crypto, including decentralized currencies such as Bitcoin. However, “Cryptocurrencies are such bad candidates for money,” he explains, adding:\n\n“They don’t have money supplies managed by humans to generate steady paths for inflation and are hugely expensive and time consuming to use in transactions.”\n\nYates’ take on Bitcoin is unsurprising. He has tweeted several times about Bitcoin, claiming that most of Bitcoin’s use is “illicit” and “speculative.”\n\nSince Bitcoin use a public ledger available for everyone, its use for illicit purposes has decreased steadily over the years to less than 1% of total transactions, reports show. \n\nOn top of that, the layer-2 Lightning Network allows instant remittance payments, while other cryptocurrencies and even stablecoins continue to grow in use cases and development.\n\nFor Yates, introducing CBDCs is akin to “making central bank reserves more widely available than just to counterparties.” But in a world where the reserve currency is the U.S. dollar, the competition for a new global CBDC is counterproductive.",2023-01-16T17:00:09.000Z

The regulator accuses Ripple and its top executives of selling XRP as an unregistered token, thus breaching the Securities Act.\n\nThe SEC and Ripple filed their final submissions toward the end of 2022, and the world is waiting anxiously to hear the court's ruling. At the center of the case are the Hinman documents and emails stating Ethereum was not a security. Legal experts like John Deaton say the lawsuit have a higher chance of going to trial than a settlement. \n\nXRP price has been falling since September, when bulls tapped out at $0.56.

If the creditor is an insider, the 90-day period is extended to one year.\n\nAs a result, creditors could seek a clawback on transfers made by FTX to external parties, including the $2.1 billion paid by FTX to Binance when Binance exited its Series A investment in FTX. Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, Binance‘s CEO, recently dismissed concerns regarding the return of the money in an interview with CNBC, saying Binance’s lawyers should handle it.\n\nIn the event of a clawback to recover funds for creditors, the bankruptcy court could require the return of the crypto assets or the money equal to the value of the crypto transferred, explained bankruptcy attorney Mark Pfeiffer, who is a member of the Blockchain and Crypto Assets Practice group at law firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney.\n\n“If the court decides to require the defendant to pay the value, it is not clear whether the amount will be the value at,” noted Pfeiffer. As a result, the court would have to determine the assets’ value considering when the transfer occurs, or when the bankruptcy or a lawsuit was filed, or when a judgment is entered. According to the insolvency lawyer:\n\n“Customers who liquidate the crypto as cash run the risk that they will have to return crypto, which exposes them to the risk that the value of the crypto will increase. Customers who hold the crypto, run the risk the court will require them to return cash even though the crypto they are holding might not be liquidated for the amount of the judgment. In other words, no matter what they do, they run the risk of compounding their problems if they guess wrong.""",2023-01-01T17:00:05.000Z

So far, crypto analytics firms are apparently not capable of tracking transactions to help prevent collapses like that of FTX.\n\nAll Bitcoin transactions are available publicly on-chain, which means people can track transactions when sending crypto from one address to another. However, this is not the case when it comes to interacting with a centralized crypto exchange.\n\nCointelegraph spoke with executives at blockchain intelligence firms — including Chainalysis, Nansen and Whale Alert — to gain more insights into the tracking of illicit CEX transactions on-chain.\n\nChainalysis, a major blockchain data platform that cooperates with many governments across the world, said there is currently no on-chain tracking tool that can trace funds through a CEX.\n\n“Chainalysis — or any other blockchain analysis tool — can’t trace funds through a centralized service because the way that these services store and manage funds deposited by users inherently makes further tracing inaccurate,” a spokesperson for Chainalysis told Cointelegraph.\n\n“Even if you could trace through a centralized exchange, on-chain analysis alone cannot reveal fraudulent intent behind transactions,” the representative noted. The spokesperson stressed that Alameda’s leaked off-chain balance sheet was the first thing to reveal that something was wrong.\n\nWhile blockchain analysis can track deposits on CEXs, there is no way to access their liabilities, according to Nansen analyst Andrew Thurman. “FTX halted withdrawals when they still had in excess of a billion in various digital assets. We now know they had a far greater sum in liabilities,” he said.\n\nThurman also argued that a proof-of-reserves model — the increasingly popular effort of CEXs to prove transparency — is “only a half measure, but it’s a good one.”\n\nDespite blockchain analysis so far having limited opportunities in tracking illicit CEX transactions, some monitoring services are trying to prove that the industry may be able to one day prevent issues like the FTX crash.",2022-12-29T17:00:11.000Z

After conducting the survey, the researchers found that a majority of the respondents believe that Web3 gaming is on its way to their firms. 75% of the participants expect to work on Web3 projects in the future.\n\nApart from this, more than half of the survey participants believe that Web3 will revolutionize the gaming industry. Some believe that Web3 will have an impact in terms of user acquisition and retention. 40% anticipate that implementing Web3 will bring more new users, while 36% believe that Web3 integration will enable games to retain users better.\n\nSekip Can Gökalp, the CEO and founder of Coda Labs, also commented on the survey results. Gökalp noted that Web3 games’ potential is always debated, but the upside for developers is always obvious. He explained that:\n\n""This survey shows that a majority of developers have already dipped their toes into Web3 game development, driven by benefits such as additional funding, new revenue streams, and player retention.”\n\nApart from getting new users and retaining them, developers also recognize that Web3 brings new revenue streams. 47% of the survey participants highlighted that one of the main benefits of Web3 is nonfungible token (NFT) sales, while 43% believe in crypto tokens as a source of additional revenue.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that Web3 is here to stay. The survey results also show that 32% of participants think that Web3 games are just a fad and will not be around for long.\n\nWhile developers who participated in the survey believe in NFTs and crypto tokens as new sources of revenue, another recent survey showed that gamers are more interested in earning Bitcoin while playing games.",2022-12-20T17:00:10.000Z

It should be always available and addressable. Content takedowns and suspensions should not be possible.”\n\nDorsey believes that the Twitter platform under his leadership and the current Twitter do not meet the three principles that he mentioned and blamed himself for not fighting for the platform.

Traders and investors seeking to leverage recent profits might interpret these indicators as cues for steering through an ongoing period of market consolidation.\n\n👉 These readings imply a period of stabilization, with no clear directional bias in the immediate term. \n\n⚡️ This suggests that in the short term, bitcoin may face more downward pressure. During Tuesday’s trading, BTC experienced a 4.46% decline against the U.S. dollar. Looking at the longer-term perspective, both EMA and SMA paint a more optimistic picture. For the 200-day period, the EMA and SMA are at $28,818 and $28,762, respectively, both indicating a more confident environment. This could mean that while short-term volatility is evident, the long-term outlook remains bullish, underlining the importance of strategic patience for long profit-takers. \n\n➡️ In this nuanced market, conservative traders might consider taking profits from long positions, waiting for flipped resistance confirmation before re-entering. Aggressive traders might explore early short positions, aiming to capitalize on the anticipated short-term reversal.\n\n🔗 The impending spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) launch could be a pivotal event influencing bitcoin’s rally duration. An unexpected announcement of an exchange-traded fund approval, however, would be extremely unfavorable for short positions in this area, leading to their rapid liquidation.",2023-11-15T16:48:02.000Z

The metric climbed from 57.11 trillion to its present value of 57.32 trillion. A difficulty rating of 57.32 trillion implies an elevated degree of effort needed to generate new blocks on the network. The difficulty undergoes adjustments every 2,016 blocks or approximately every two weeks.\n\n❕ If a greater number of miners enter the network and contribute computing power, leading to the mining of 2,016 blocks in less than two weeks, the difficulty will rise. Conversely, should miners exit the network and the same number of blocks take longer than two weeks to mine, the difficulty will decrease.\n\n⏺ The most recent adjustment (+0.35%) was an increase, as was the change (+5.48%) that transpired on September 19. A difficulty level of 57.32 trillion creates a significant obstacle for miners seeking to discover blocks.\n\n🔩 Miners must create a hash from the block’s data when attempting to mine new blocks. Utilizing the SHA256 hash function, a hash is generated as a fixed-length string of numbers and letters based on input data. Miners strive to find a hash lower than the current target value determined by the network’s degree of difficulty.",2023-10-04T12:22:18.000Z

Prosecutors in South Korea believe that Kwon’s purported bitcoin stash was transferred to an international exchange.\n\nA report by KBS journalist Jieun Lee details that South Korean prosecutors have discovered 414.5 billion won ($314 million) in alleged criminal proceeds tied to employees of Terraform Labs. The report indicates that prosecutors estimate 91.4 billion won is associated with Do Kwon, the co-founder, and 154.1 billion won is purportedly linked to co-founder Shin Hyun-seong, also known as Daniel Shin.\n\nSeven other Terraform Labs staff members are reportedly associated with an additional 169 billion won. The KBS journalist also reported that South Korean investigators suspect Kwon of selling “a large part of his property to bitcoin and transferring it to an overseas virtual asset exchange.” Furthermore, South Korean prosecutors have contacted the cryptocurrency exchange Binance and requested that the exchange “block the withdrawal of cryptocurrency owned by CEO Kwon.”\n\nThree days ago, the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor’s Office’s financial and securities crime unit revealed that investigators had seized real estate worth 210 billion won from eight Terraform Labs team members, including Daniel Shin.

Pershing Square is a hedge fund management company with approximately $18.5 billion in assets under management. Ackman’s net worth is about $3.4 billion.\n\nCommenting on the current banking crisis following the failures of major banks, including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, Ackman tweeted Wednesday:\n\nConsider recent events impact on the long-term cost of equity capital for non-systemically important banks where you can wake up one day as a shareholder or bondholder and your investment instantly goes to zero.\n\nSystemically important banks (SIBs) are banks that are considered to be so large or complex that their failure could have a significant impact on the financial system and the wider economy. On the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) 2022 list, there are 30 systemically important banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, HSBC, and the troubled Credit Suisse.\n\n“When combined with the higher cost of debt and deposits due to rising rates, consider what the impact will be on lending rates and our economy,” Ackman continued, warning:\n\nThe longer this banking crisis is allowed to continue, the greater the damage to smaller banks and their ability to access low-cost capital. Trust and confidence are earned over many years, but can be wiped out in a few days. I fear we are heading for a train wreck. Hopefully, our regulators will get this right.\n\nThe billionaire believes the government should guarantee all bank deposits. On March 22, he tweeted explaining that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s “reassuring comments” the previous day “led the market and depositors to believe that all deposits were now implicitly guaranteed.” He also referenced “a leak” suggesting that Yellen, the Treasury Department, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) “were looking for a way to guarantee all deposits reassured the banking sector and depositors.”\n\nHowever, Yellen then “walked back yesterday’s implicit support for small banks and depositors, while making it explicit that systemwide deposit guarantees were not being considered,” Ackman’s tweet adds.\n\n“We have gone from implicit support for depositors to Secretary Yellen’s explicit statement today that no guarantee is being considered,” he further opined, noting that the Federal Reserve has raised the federal funds rate to 4.75%-5.00%. “5% is a threshold that makes bank deposits that much less attractive. I would be surprised if deposit outflows don’t accelerate effective immediately,” Ackman cautioned, elaborating:\n\nA temporary systemwide deposit guarantee is needed to stop the bleeding. The longer the uncertainty continues, the more permanent the damage is to the smaller banks, and the more difficult it will be to bring their customers back.",2023-03-26T18:15:00.000Z

The idea behind this would be to keep prices stable and avoid repricing articles each day, a practice that has already been adopted in other Latam countries like 🇻🇪Venezuela, which present high levels of inflation.\n\n🟢The U.S. dollar is starting to make inroads in Argentina as a unit of account. According to reports from local outlets, some Argentine stores and retailers are pricing their goods in dollars, seeking to avoid constant repricing due to the devaluation of the national fiat currency, the Argentine peso.\n\n🟢According to reports from La Nacion, these prices are mostly associated with clothing, including sneakers, and branded t-shirts and caps, that are mostly imported from other countries. However, to purchase these articles, customers can also pay with Argentine pesos, using the informal exchange rate, called “blue,” as a reference to calculate the final price in local currency.\n\nAlfredo González, President of the Argentine Confederation of SMEs, explains providers are also setting their prices in dollars when dealing with imported articles. On this, he stated:\n\n🗣It is very difficult to survive with these levels of inflation. We have a hard time getting merchandise, the price lists are updated at least every two weeks. It is difficult to obtain the reference values for some particular products. We are very concerned, and busy, with the issue.\n\n🇦🇷Argentina is looking for ways to control its inflation levels, which reached almost 100% in 2022, and devaluation of its fiat currency, which has prompted the central bank to issue new bills with higher values. Alberto Fernandez, the Argentine president, recently informed about a joint initiative of several Latam countries in order to fight inflation that would be defined in a summit on March 17.",2023-03-08T17:41:02.000Z

The decision to shut down Silvergate Exchange Network followed the withdrawal of banking relationships by several major cryptocurrency firms, including Coinbase, Gemini, Paxos, and Circle.\n\nSilvergate Bank announced Friday that its cryptocurrency payments network, the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), has been terminated. According to a notice posted on the crypto-focused bank’s website:\n\n🗣Effective immediately Silvergate Bank has made a risk-based decision to discontinue the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN). All other deposit-related services remain operational.\n\nSEN is Silvergate’s proprietary network that allows the bank’s institutional investor and digital currency clients to transfer U.S. dollars between their Silvergate accounts and the accounts of other Silvergate clients 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nConcerns mounted over Silvergate’s financial stability and future prospects following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. The bank claimed that as of Sept. 20, 2022, FTX represented less than 10% of its $11.9 billion total deposits from all digital asset customers. Nonetheless, the bank is reportedly being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) over accounts tied to the disgraced FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF).\n\nOn Wednesday, Silvergate informed the SEC that it is unable to file its annual report with the regulator for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31 “within the prescribed time period without unreasonable effort or expense due to the reasons described below.” The crypto-focused bank also revealed that it has sold additional debt securities at a loss this year, leading to questions about the company’s ability to operate as a going concern. The filing further states that the bank’s continued losses could result in it being “less than well capitalized.” Silvergate added:\n\n🗣The company is currently in the process of reevaluating its businesses and strategies in light of the business and regulatory challenges it currently faces.\n\nAfter Silvergate raised concerns about its business, crypto-focused firms including Coinbase Global, Galaxy Digital, Paxos, Circle, Cboe’s digital asset exchange, Bitstamp, and Gemini suspended their banking partnership with Silvergate.\n\nShares of Silvergate (NYSE: SI) hit a new all-time low on Thursday, plummeting over 97% from their peak in November 2021. Last month, Silvergate became the most shorted stock in the U.S. The bank incurred a loss of $1 billion in the fourth quarter of last year.",2023-03-05T18:00:03.000Z

The financial institution underscored the advantages of using a digital form of the document and pointed out that demand for yuan payments is growing.\n\nMoscow Credit Bank (MKB) has issued what it described as Russia’s first digital bank guarantee for an amount exceeding 100 million Chinese yuan, using blockchain technology — the Masterchain platform developed by the Central Bank of Russia.\n\n🟢In a press release quoted by RBC Crypto, MKB explained that the guarantee is denominated in the currency to which the importer’s contracts are linked. In case of a payment under it, the supplier will receive Russian rubles at an exchange rate agreed upon by the parties.\n\n⭐️The bank guarantee was agreed on by the three stakeholders: the principal, the guarantor bank, and the beneficiary. The touted advantage of using a digital document, which ostensibly cannot be forged or lost, is that the beneficiary doesn’t need to wait for the paper version or request a confirmation from the bank about the authenticity of the guarantee.\n\n“This is the first digital bank guarantee in the market, which was issued in yuan, through the Masterchain system. Most foreign trade contracts are serviced in Chinese currency, and the demand for payments in yuan is only growing,” commented Natalya Bahova, director of MKB’s International and Structured Finance Department.\n\nThe executive added this is a “logical step” and that it’s likely to see more such examples in the future. “The decision will be especially relevant for large groups of companies which have many subsidiaries that accept bank guarantees in large quantities and on a regular basis,” Bahova elaborated.\n\nRussian companies spend around 900 million rubles annually (almost $12 million) to verify the authenticity of bank guarantees, the report noted.",2023-03-02T18:19:03.000Z

Local reports indicate that, while the most popular use case for the stablecoin involves its purchase for devaluation shielding purposes, a handful of companies are also harnessing it in this way.\n\nWhile the use of dollar-pegged stablecoins, like Tether’s USDT, in countries like Venezuela is mainly related to inflation and devaluation according to Chainalysis, a second use case has also been discovered recently.

The new partner is expected to help the central bank implement a system which gives it greater control of the digital currency. One expert said the central bank should consider improving user experience if it wants to see more Nigerians adopting the e-naira.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is seeking to install a new system to run its central bank digital currency (CBDC) and is currently talking to prospective technology partners, a report has said. According to a report, the central bank is keen on developing digital currency technology that gives it greater control of the CBDC.\n\nR3, a provider of enterprise technology and services, is one of the prospective partners that has reportedly discussed deploying a different tech for the e-naira. As per the report, the CBN’s chosen partner is not expected to immediately oust the central bank’s initial technology partner, Bitt Inc. Instead, the central bank hopes the new partnership will help it achieve its goal of controlling the CBDC’s underlying technology.\n\nWhile no official comment concerning the CBN’s plans has been given, Bitt Inc reportedly acknowledged that the Nigerian central bank “works with various service providers to explore technical innovations for their digital infrastructure.” Despite this, the Barbados-based technology firm said it still works closely with the CBN and is “currently developing additional features and enhancements.”\n\nRemarking on the CBN’s reported plans, Lucky Uwakwe Arisukwu, the CEO of the 4th industrial revolution technology hub Sabi Group, concurred that the central bank’s desire to control digital currency could be the primary motivating factor. To support this viewpoint, Uwakwe made reference to the recently launched domestic card scheme known as Afrigo.\n\nJust like the e-naira, the Afrigo scheme seeks to bolster the country’s national payment system as well as to deepen the usage of electronic platforms in Nigeria. Although the CBN governor has rejected assertions that the card scheme seeks to push out international service providers, Uwakwe argued that the central bank could not have launched this scheme if it lacked control. According to Uwakwe, the CBN wants to apply the same approach to the e-naira.\n\nDespite it being Africa’s only functioning CBDC, uptake of the e-naira has been slow, and according to a Bitcoin News report in August 2022, just under one million e-naira speed wallets had been downloaded at the time. The Nigerian public’s then lukewarm response reportedly prompted the CBN to look for ways of getting more Nigerians to download the e-naira speed wallet.\n\nOne of the ways the CBN has attempted to achieve this is by offering rewards to residents or merchants that accept the e-naira. In addition to these incentives, Uwakwe said the CBN should also work on improving user experience if it wants to see more Nigerians using the CBDC.\n\n“If the user experience is improved upon, definitely they would have a great of adoption. The central bank also needs to for instance consider mandating that all civil servants should receive a part of their salary paid in the e-naira format,” Uwakwe said.\n\nThe Sabi CEO also noted how commercial banks’ failure or reluctance to allow for the seamless conversion of the e-naira to the fiat naira and vice versa is possibly working against the CBN’s efforts.",2023-02-24T17:00:10.000Z

The official elaborated:\n\nIn the course of this year, measures around crypto would be brought out.\n\nThe Economic Affairs secretary added: “In India, nobody is talking about using crypto as a currency. The risks are with using it as a token.”\n\nThe Indian government has been working on crypto legislation for several years. A draft crypto bill was unveiled in 2019 but it was never taken up in parliament.\n\nIndian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman reportedly stated Friday in a post-budget interview with Network18 Group that she will be looking at developing a global standard operating procedure (SOP) for regulating crypto assets in her upcoming G20 meeting. Under India’s presidency, the first meeting of the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors is scheduled to be held on Feb. 24-25 in Bengaluru.\n\nSitharaman said:\n\nWe will be looking at global SOP to be available and agreed upon for regulating crypto assets while recognizing the central bank as the authority for issuing cryptocurrencies.\n\n“The rest of the assets created outside that are using very useful financial technologies. Even those have to be discussed because regulations cannot be done by one country singularly, it has to be a collective action because technology doesn’t brook any borders,” the finance minister noted.\n\nDuring her Budget speech last week, Sitharaman did not mention crypto assets. However, this year’s Finance Bill included several new tax penalties relating to crypto tax deducted at source (TDS). This year’s Economic Survey 2023 also highlighted the need for “a common approach to regulating the crypto ecosystem.”\n\nIndia’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has repeatedly recommended banning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.

The company claims its software can pair the onchain addresses of users with their social accounts, giving Web3 marketers more knowledge about their audiences to make efficient advertising campaigns in the crypto sector.\n\nMarketing agencies have had a difficult time advertising Web3 products to their audiences due to the lack of insight they have into these services. Addressable, a software startup, has raised $7.5 million in its seed round on the claims that it might have the solution to this problem. The round, which had the support of Viola Ventures, Fabric Ventures, Mensch Capital Partners, and North Island Ventures, banks on the capabilities of Addressable’s software.\n\nThe company claims that it can pair the onchain addresses of users with their social media profiles, making marketers capable of getting key data on their potential target audiences. This data can help them to design specialized campaigns to entice a certain kind of Web3 audience, and then point these to their social profiles on platforms like Twitter.\n\nAddressable’s software has to choose each user in a poll of more than 500 million Web3 addresses from several chains, and cross-reference them with the whole universe of social network accounts existing on different platforms today. For now, the company supports Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Fuse, Arbitrum, and other EVMs for targeting purposes, For tracking, only audiences on the Ethereum blockchain are monitored, with support for Polygon and Binance Smart Chain coming in the future.\n\nAddressable’s business model is not unique, as there are already other companies that are also trying to solve the Web3 marketing problem. Tomer Sharoni, co-founder and CEO of Addressable, told Techcrunch about the competition that the company faces, and how they are trying to differentiate from these other startups. He stated:\n\nAddressable competes with other Web3 CRM startups including such as Blaze, Cookie3, Kazm and Absolute Labs, that focus mainly on customer reactivation by analyzing and engaging with the company’s existing onchain user base.\n\nHowever, Sharoni states that Addressable had a more holistic approach, as they aim to unlock all Web3 onchain users. Also, the company states that they protect the privacy of the users targeted, as their customers cannot target users as individual data points, and no info is saved on their servers.",2023-02-03T17:00:11.000Z

The ministry was quoted by local media as saying:\n\nWe will overhaul the forensic infrastructure in response to the modernization of crime.\n\nThe Korean government has been talking about adopting a system to track down illegal crypto transactions for many months. In October last year, the country’s Supreme Prosecutors’ Office said it was in the process of purchasing a cryptocurrency tracking system via the Public Procurement Service.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice noted that it will develop its own crypto tracking and analysis system in the latter half of the year.\n\nThe MOJ announcement followed a statement by Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) Governor Lee Bok-hyun, who said earlier this month that the regulator is planning to develop crypto monitoring tools to regularly inspect the risks associated with crypto assets.

She warned that the SEC’s current enforcement-centric approach would take 400 years to go through all the crypto tokens that are allegedly securities.\n\nA commissioner with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Hester Peirce, talked about crypto regulation in her speech at the “Digital Assets at Duke” conference on Jan. 20.\n\nNoting that the securities regulator has “pursued registration violations in a seemingly random fashion, often years after the original offering,” the commissioner stressed:\n\nWe must develop a coherent and consistent legal framework that works across all asset classes. Our imprecise application of the law has created arbitrary and destructive results for crypto projects and purchasers.\n\n“When we insist on applying the securities laws in this manner, secondary purchasers of the token often are left holding a bag of tokens that they cannot trade or use because the SEC requires special handling consistent with the securities laws,” Peirce warned. “Many of these requirements are enforced under a strict liability standard, so clarity is essential.”\n\nThe commissioner continued, “Why not set forth a coherent legal framework in a rule?” elaborating:\n\nAfter all, if we continued with our regulation-by-enforcement approach at our current pace, we would approach 400 years before we got through the tokens that are allegedly securities.\n\n“By contrast, an SEC rule would have universal—albeit not retroactive—coverage as soon as it took effect,” she noted.\n\nCommissioner Peirce further explained: “A rational framework should facilitate the compliance of good faith crypto actors with our securities laws, which would free the SEC to focus more of its resources on the bad faith actors.”\n\nHowever, she cautioned:\n\nCrypto regulation is not easy to do well. If crypto institutions are treated like regular depository institutions, requiring heavy layers of capital and lots of legal staffing, crypto innovation is likely to dwindle.\n\nThis was not the first time Commissioner Peirce has raised concerns about the way the SEC has been regulating the crypto sector. She has repeatedly criticized the securities watchdog for taking an enforcement-centric approach to regulating the crypto space. She also believes that the regulator should have already approved a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). In May last year, she warned that the SEC has dropped the ball on crypto oversight, stating: “We’re not allowing innovation to develop and experimentation to happen in a healthy way, and there are long-term consequences of that failure.”\n\nCommissioner Peirce is not the only one who is concerned about the SEC’s enforcement-centric approach. U.S. Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN), for example, has repeatedly criticized SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. “Under Chair Gensler, the SEC has become a power-hungry regulator,” the lawmaker said in July last year.",2023-01-28T17:00:07.000Z

A law “On Virtual Assets” was passed by the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament, in mid-February.\n\nFor this legislation to come into full force, amendments to the Tax Code are also needed. Once they are adopted, Ukraine will have the best crypto jurisdiction in the world, Fedorov insisted, further pointing out:\n\nUkraine is a candidate for EU membership. We have to harmonize with European law, taking into account the practices and recommendations of the IMF and the World Bank.\n\nThe Ukrainian official also marked the progress towards issuing a Ukrainian central bank digital currency (CBDC). “Two weeks ago, I saw a pilot of electronic hryvnia,” he said, referring to the project which is being realized in cooperation with Stellar and a private bank.\n\nThe National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) intends to propose in 2024 legislation dedicated to the introduction of the CBDC, Mykhailo Fedorov revealed. “I plan to become its first test user and receive my salary in e-hryvnia,” he stated.\n\nDespite the raging conflict with Russia, the authorities in Kyiv have a “very ambitious plan” to make Ukraine the most digitalized country in the next two years. “Digitalization is going to be the foundation for rebuilding. We are doing these reforms during the war,” Fedorov explained.\n\nThe vice prime minister also highlighted the support his nation is getting on the road to digitalization, in terms of resources and experience from G7 countries like the United States and Japan.

Among numerous questions asked was whether he believes the recent Federal Reserve interest rate increases will actually cause widespread deflation. Booth replied:\n\nIf they keep hiking, it will ‘eventually’ turn into debt deflation — or credit wipeout. (ala great depression on steroids). Eventually, they will be forced to pivot.\n\n“One important consideration for people is to think in terms of lag effect…ie 18 months from when actions are set in motion,” he continued. “Remember when no inflation, transitory inflation, high inflation,” Booth added, cautioning:\n\nThis tightening only really started in September and Fed only reduced their balance sheet by 2.7 % last year — with subsequent damage…. If they continue…..ugly.\n\nBooth published a book titled “The Price of Tomorrow: Why Deflation is the Key to an Abundant Future” in 2020. In his book, the author explored “the problem of how to integrate the deflation brought on by technology into a system where inflation has been the norm,” according to the book’s overview. Booth believes “we can avoid a looming economic crisis if we can learn to embrace what abundance brings, which could even be a world without work.”\n\nBooth has long been a proponent of bitcoin.

A new report prepared by exchanges reports that most of these banks refuse to include crypto companies as customers for risks that are nevertheless managed in the case of servicing other kinds of customers.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges and other crypto-related companies are still fighting private banks for the right to open and manage bank accounts in Chile. The legal fight, which started back in 2018 when a series of exchanges had their bank accounts closed by several banking institutions, will be defined this year before a national free competition court.\n\nBuda, a Chilean exchange, prepared a document that concluded that banks are colluding to deny their services to cryptocurrency exchanges for reasons applicable to other businesses, like companies operating with jewelry, watches, vehicles of all kinds, works of art, or antiques.\n\nRegarding these businesses, the document states that they “are universally recognized as a possible means for money laundering – and who, moreover, are regulated by being obligated subjects in comparative law, but not in Chilean law,” and criticizes using money laundering and the lack of clear regulations in crypto as a mere pretext for taking uncompetitive actions.\n\nThe defense of private banks centers around the fact that there are still no defined protocols for managing risks associated with cryptocurrency operations, and that money laundering activities, if happen, would be unable to be detected and handled. However, exchanges discuss that banks act against exchanges based on no clear laws, with 79% of the closing or service-denying events happening in a period of three months.\n\nBice Bank, one of the banks included in the lawsuit, states that it had defined it would not operate with cryptocurrency-based companies three years before the trial started, establishing it would do so only when there was due diligence and the approval of the anti-money laundering and terrorism financing regulator.\n\nOn the other hand, Security Bank, another financial institution stated that its decision derives from the fact that cryptocurrency exchanges “do not have the necessary regulation to adequately prevent these risks and they will not have it in the short term either.”\n\nHowever, regulation in the field is slowly coming apart, as Chile approved and recently sanctioned a fintech law that includes cryptocurrency in its scope.

The 172-page report includes discussions on crypto assets, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and decentralized finance (defi).\n\n“Regulating new technology and business models after they have grown to a systemic level is challenging,” the RBI report states. “To promote responsible innovation and to mitigate financial stability risks in crypto ecosystem, it is vital for policymakers to design an appropriate policy approach.” The Indian central bank continued:\n\nIn this context, under India’s G20 presidency, one of the priorities is to develop a framework for global regulation, including the possibility of prohibition, of unbacked crypto assets, stablecoins, and defi.\n\nThe central bank named “turmoil in crypto assets market” one of “the major risks that can potentially undermine global financial stability.” The RBI also said crypto assets are highly volatile, “exhibit high correlations with equities,” and have fallen as inflation rose.\n\nThe report further notes that the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and subsequent crypto market sell-offs “have highlighted the inherent vulnerabilities in the crypto ecosystem.” It also highlights the terra/luna meltdown in May and the bankruptcy filings of several major crypto firms, including crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and crypto lender Celsius Network.\n\nAjay Seth, India’s economic affairs secretary, said earlier this month that the G20 members aim to build a policy consensus on crypto assets for better global regulation. Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in October that crypto will be part of India’s agenda during its G20 presidency, adding that she hopes a technology-driven regulation framework for crypto assets will be established.\n\nThe members of the Group of 20 (G20) are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the U.K., the U.S., and the European Union.

This year, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has emerged as “the institutional-grade digital asset,” said Microstrategy founder Michael Saylor.\n\nNasdaq-listed Microstrategy Inc. announced Wednesday that it has purchased more bitcoin for its corporate treasury. Michael Saylor, the company’s founder and executive chairman, tweeted Wednesday:\n\nMicrostrategy has increased its bitcoin holdings by ~2,500 BTC. As of 12/27/22 Microstrategy holds ~132,500 bitcoin acquired for ~$4.03 billion at an average price of ~$30,397 per bitcoin.\n\nIn its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Microstrategy clarified that the 2,500 coins were acquired between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24 by its wholly owned subsidiary Macrostrategy.\n\nThe subsidiary bought approximately 2,395 BTC at an average price of $17,871 per coin between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21. It then sold about 704 BTC at $16,776 per coin on Dec. 22. Macrostrategy then bought about 810 more BTC at $16,845 per coin on Dec. 24. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $16,656.80.\n\nThe bitcoin sale in December marked the first time Microstrategy sold its bitcoin since it began accumulating the crypto for its corporate treasury in 2020. The company cited tax reasons for selling BTC. “Microstrategy plans to carry back the capital losses resulting from this transaction against previous capital gains, to the extent such carrybacks are available under the federal income tax laws currently in effect, which may generate a tax benefit,” the SEC filing describes.\n\nSaylor said in an interview last week:\n\nThe most positive thing of the year is the emergence of bitcoin as the institutional grade digital asset and the clarity that … there is one crypto asset that’s a digital commodity … Bitcoin is that commodity.\n\nThe executive noted that both the chairman of the SEC and the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have confirmed that bitcoin is a commodity.\n\nSaylor previously explained that Microstrategy is investing in BTC “for the long term.” He added: “Our strategy is to buy bitcoin and hold the bitcoin, so there’s no price target … I expect bitcoin is going to go into the millions.

The man says he donated the digital cash stolen from the illicit website to an organization delivering humanitarian aid across his war-torn homeland.\n\nUkrainian-born cyber intelligence expert Alex Holden, who left Kyiv as a teenager in the 1980s and now lives in Mequon, Wisconsin, claims he has hacked into Solaris, one of Russia’s largest online drug markets, Forbes informs in a report.\n\nSupported by his team at Hold Security, he was able to get hold of some of the bitcoin sent to dealers and the darknet site’s owners. The cryptocurrency, worth over $25,000, was later transferred to Enjoying Life, a charitable foundation based in the Ukrainian capital.\n\nWithout revealing exactly how he did it, Holden explained he took control of much of the internet infrastructure behind Solaris, including some administrator accounts, obtained the website’s source code and a database of its users and drop off locations for drug deliveries.\n\nFor a while, the Ukrainian and his colleagues also gained access to the “master wallet” of the marketplace. It was used by buyers and dealers to deposit and withdraw funds and operated as the platform’s crypto exchange, the article details.\n\nGiven the rapid turnover, the wallet rarely had more than 3 BTC at a time. Holden managed to appropriate 1.6 BTC and send it to Enjoying Life. Hold Security donated another $8,000 to the charity, which provides assistance to people affected by the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe darknet market Solaris is suspected of having connections to the hacking crew Killnet, which after Moscow launched its invasion in late February became one of Russia’s “patriotic” hacker groups vowing to target Ukrainians and their supporters.\n\nKillnet has also conducted a number of attacks in the U.S., including on airport and state government websites as well as the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. It reportedly hit the Eurovision song contest, the Estonian government and Italy’s National Health Institute.\n\nThe group was also blamed for attacking Rutor, the main rival of Solaris, which became Russia’s leading underground drugs market after Hydra was shut down this past spring. According to U.S. cybersecurity firm Zerofox, Solaris was paying Killnet for DDoS services.\n\nBesides the battlefield, Russia and Ukraine have also clashed in the online space, with the government in Kyiv recruiting experts for its own cyberforce. The special unit was tasked to identify and prevent Russian attacks but also hack back.\n\nHits such as those on Russia’s largest bank, Sber, and the Moscow Stock Exchange have been attributed to the Ukrainian IT army.

The central bank said individuals and corporate organizations withdrawing amounts exceeding the new limits would be required to pay processing fees of 3% and 5% respectively.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said that starting on Jan. 9, 2023, individual banking clients will be able to withdraw an equivalent of $1,120 (N500,000) per week, up from the under $50 cap introduced on Dec. 6. For corporate organizations, the CBN said the cash withdrawal would be capped at $11,200, a nearly tenfold increase from the previously announced limit.\n\nIn a new circular to heads of financial institutions, the CBN, which is pushing for the broader adoption of its digital currency, said its decision to revise the cash withdrawal limits was “based on feedback received from stakeholders.” The bank added that while it pushes for a cashless society it remains mindful of the role played by cash, particularly in underserved communities.\n\n“The CBN recognizes the vital role that cash plays in supporting underserved and rural communities and will ensure an inclusive approach as it implements the transition to a more cash-less society,” the central bank statement said.\n\nAs previously reported by Bitcoin News, the Nigerian central bank’s decision to restrict cash withdrawals came as it prepared to unveil new banknotes.

As the billionaire seeks a new CEO to run the social media platform, privacy advocate Edward Snowden threw his name in the hat, stating that he takes payment in bitcoin. “The question is not finding a CEO, the question is finding a CEO who can keep Twitter alive,” Musk clarified.\n\nElon Musk set up a poll on Twitter over the weekend asking his 122.3 million followers whether he should step down as head of the social media platform. The billionaire added that he will abide by the results of the poll, which ended with 57.5% of over 17.5 million respondents wanting him to step down.\n\nResponding to a comment about him having a new CEO picked out already and that he will retire to being chairman of the Twitter board, Musk clarified: “No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.” In another tweet, the Tesla chief explained:\n\nThe question is not finding a CEO, the question is finding a CEO who can keep Twitter alive.\n\nMany people urged Musk not to quit. “If Elon Musk steps down from Twitter, I will close my account. He’s why I opened it in the first place,” one exclaimed. “The crowd chose to crucify Jesus too, remember that Elon Musk. The crowd is not always right. Leaders LEAD, they don’t bow!” another told the billionaire. “Stand up for free speech. The First Amendment needs you,” a third user emphasized.\n\nIn November, Musk said in court that he did not want to be the CEO of Twitter, stating: “I expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time.”\n\nComments from people indicating that they could serve as the new Twitter CEO also flooded Musk’s tweet. Among those who responded was whistleblower Edward Snowden, a free speech and privacy advocate who has been living in exile in Russia after he exposed a National Security Agency (NSA) spying program affecting millions of Americans in 2013. He wrote: “I take payment in bitcoin.”\n\nReplying to a question about whether he is “strong enough to be despised” as the CEO of Twitter, noting that Musk’s main problem is that he is “being steered by right-wing crazies away from what he wanted Twitter 2.0 to be,” Snowden wrote:\n\nOh, I think I’ve weathered a little criticism in the past.\n\nSome people complained that they did not see Musk’s poll in time to vote. Many users suspect that most voters were bots. “This poll is not fair, I didn’t even see it till the last day because this time of the year, like me, most people are busy getting ready for the holidays and haven’t been able to even log in, and probably most of the votes on this poll are from made up Dem accounts!” one user stressed.\n\nKim Dotcom told Musk: “It’s unwise to run a poll like this when you are now deep state enemy #1. They have the biggest bot army on Twitter. They have 100k ‘analysts’ with 30-40 accounts all voting against you. Let’s clean up and then run this poll again.

Power utilities are detecting their increased consumption and trying to make them pay at commercial rates.\n\nElectricity distribution companies in Russia have started to identify improvised mining farms in residential buildings by the rising volume of energy consumption and higher loads on the grid at substations, Deputy Ministry of Energy Pavel Snikkars revealed to the Russian press.\n\nThe government official told the daily Izvestia that authorities are going after the “illegal miners.” While crypto mining is yet to be regulated and such activities are not explicitly prohibited right now, utilities can prove in courts that these consumers are not using the electricity for domestic needs.\n\nLawyers interviewed by the newspaper said that in at least 10 cases so far, the suppliers have been able to oblige home miners to cover the difference between the preferential tariffs for the general population and the higher rates that businesses are required to pay.\n\nWhen increased power consumption triggers their suspicions, the utilities would initially send an inspector to check and issue a new invoice based on the price of electricity used for commercial purposes, Snikkars explained. Eventually, they could try to prove their claims in court.\n\nIrkutskenergosbyt, the electricity distributer in the energy-rich region of Irkutsk dubbed “the mining capital of Russia,” was among the first to deal with the issue in 2021. According to a report in August of this year, crypto miners in the Siberian oblast, where rates start at just $0.01 per kWh in rural districts, have already paid 100 million rubles in fines (almost $1.7 million at the time).\n\nPavel Snikkars unveiled last week that Russia expects a sizable increase in the share of cryptocurrency miners in its total consumption of electrical power. He also emphasized that at-home mining is a big problem in certain areas where the infrastructure is not capable of handling the loads and energy companies have been taking measures to ensure reliable supplies for other users.\n\nRussian crypto mining needs about 1.7 GW of electricity, 50 – 60% of which is utilized in the industrial segment of the market, according to Oleg Ogienko, director for government relations at Bitriver, one of Russia’s largest mining farm operators.\n\nMining is one of the crypto-related activities that the Russian government wants to legalize and regulate in order to take advantage of the country’s competitive advantages for the industry such as cheap energy resources and cool climate conditions.\n\nIn November, a group of lawmakers filed a bill with the lower house of parliament designed to regulate the minting of digital currencies like bitcoin through amendments to the country’s existing law “On Digital Financial Assets.” The legislation was backed by the Bank of Russia and expectations are that it will be adopted by the end of the year.",2022-12-14T17:00:09.000Z

The department supports a bill designed to regulate the sector which is likely to be adopted this year.\n\nThe share of cryptocurrency miners may reach 1.5 – 2% of Russia’s total consumption of electrical power by the end of 2022, according to the Russian Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Snikkars. During a crypto conference organized by the business news portal RBC, the government official recalled that last year’s figure was around 1%.\n\nThe availability of electricity for mining across the vast country would depend on the number of users that want to connect to the grid in a particular location, Snikkars added. In certain Russian regions — the deputy minister mentioned Murmansk as an example — unused power generating capacities are currently being offered to the crypto industry.\n\nSnikkars explained the availability of such resources with the way new power plants are built. A decision to start the construction of one, which may take up to a decade in the case of nuclear stations, is based on requests from potential consumers in the area. However, some projects are not ready to launch on time or at all and, as a result, the generating capacities are not fully loaded.\n\nIndividuals minting digital currencies are also causing trouble raising consumption in certain places with low electricity rates, where the infrastructure cannot handle the growing power usage, the expert said.

On Nov 25. at an online event, Campos Neto introduced the ideas that the institution has for the currency, under the “open finance” name.\n\nThis idea includes the integration of the digital real, which is still under development, with traditional and decentralized financial structures and institutions. A “super app,” that will allow customers to hold stablecoins and the CBDC, was also shown in the event, showcasing the connection the system will have with the already available PIX payments network.\n\nOn the app mockup, Campos Neto clarified:\n\nThis is basically a teaser of what this integration I’m talking about will be. Instead of having several apps on your cell phone, from several banks, you will have some kind of integrator.\n\nIn this way, the app will allow the users to have a complete picture of their savings, traditional or crypto-based, in just one place.\n\nWhile the digital real concept has been in development for quite some time, there is no estimated date for its completion, as the central bank and other organizations continue to test the different implementations and functions this new coin would have. However, Campos Neto stated that the currency will be a bridge to decentralized finance, as the country pushes towards monetary digitization.\n\nOn this, Campos Neto explained:\n\nThe digital real part is a bridge to the defi environment. We are bringing the digital world to the banking system. Several other central banks are doing the opposite. They are actually pushing digital out of banking.\n\nHowever, contrary to what Campos Neto states, several central bank digital currencies are already being tested by myriad central banks. The European Union is currently studying the implementation of a digital euro and is expected to regulate it soon. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is also piloting an interoperable network of central bank wholesale digital money, and a proposal has surged in Argentina to eliminate physical money.",2022-11-29T17:00:07.000Z

The document states that crypto regulation has failed to grow with the adoption of these new technologies and that governments have often failed to detect and punish crypto-related crimes.\n\nWhile the adoption of cryptocurrency has grown immensely in Latam due to the unique economic situations and difficulties of the countries in the area, cryptocurrency regulation has failed to develop on par. This is one of the conclusions that a report titled “Cryptocurrencies: A Financial Crime Risk within Latin America and the Caribbean,” issued on Nov. 14, found.\n\nProduced by Global Financial Integrity, a Washington DC-based financial think tank, the report examined the legal cryptocurrency developments in Latam and the Caribbean, focusing on countries with high crypto adoption like Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, and Mexico.\n\nThe report found several holes in the regulations of some of these countries that could allow criminals to use crypto to commit money laundering crimes which could go undetected by the authorities. Also, the study remarks that some of these countries still lack crypto-specific regulations to tackle more than just crypto taxation, given that Latam’s cryptocurrency usage follows different trends compared to other regions.\n\nAs per the study, it is fundamental for these countries to understand that cryptocurrencies are a new asset class that calls to be studied in order to establish effective regulations, taking the needs of each one of the countries in Latam into account. The promotion of campaigns that educate about crypto and the possible risks that users and investors can face while using these new currencies is another tool that governments can utilize.\n\nHowever, according to the report, one of the most important measures that these governments must apply has to do with the implementation of KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) protocols amongst service providers, which can serve to identify possible threats.\n\nIn the same way, the adoption of the recommendations of international organizations like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is advised, in conjunction with the interconnection of these agencies to collaborate and exchange data that could lead to prosecuting suspected criminal cases.",2022-11-26T17:00:06.000Z

In addition, the bill (if passed into law) would require crypto holders to furnish Kenya’s Capital Markets Authority with details such as “the amount of proceeds from the transaction, any costs related to the transaction, and the amount of any gain or loss on the transaction.”\n\nAs per a capital markets amendment bill reportedly before the Kenyan parliament, individuals holding cryptocurrencies might in the future be required to pay taxes commensurate with the gains made, a report has said. Kenyans holding cryptocurrency for a period exceeding twelve months will be required to pay capital gains tax while those holding for less than a year are obliged to pay income tax.\n\nBesides Kenyan crypto holders, the amendment bill also seeks to introduce taxes that target cryptocurrency exchanges and digital wallets. According to a Business Daily report, the amendment bill is being sponsored by Abraham Kirwa, a member of parliament (MP) for the Mosop constituency.\n\nIn addition to proposing taxes, the bill proposes that persons holding digital assets must share details concerning how and when the crypto was acquired with Kenya’s Capital Markets Authority (CMA).\n\n“A person who possesses or deals in digital currency shall provide the Authority with the following information for tax purposes—the amount of proceeds from the transaction, any costs related to the transaction, and the amount of any gain or loss on the transaction,” the amendment bill reportedly states.\n\nMeanwhile, Kirwa is quoted in the report stating that his bill seeks to “provide for specific provisions to govern digital currency transactions in Kenya.” The bill also proposes what the MP defines as the “responsibilities of persons or businesses trading in digital currencies, providing for its taxation, ownership, and providing for the promotion of innovation in this area.”\n\nAs has been reported by Bitcoin News previously, Kenya has one of the highest concentrations of cryptocurrency holders in Africa and is one of the biggest crypto markets on the continent. Despite this embrace of crypto by Kenyans, authorities in the country including Central Bank of Kenya governor Patrick Njoroge, have repeatedly railed against the use of privately issued digital currencies.\n\nHowever, the Kenyan lawmaker’s bill appears to acknowledge that the warnings by Njoroge and others have failed to dissuade Kenyans from using or holding cryptocurrencies. Therefore, in addition to the above-mentioned proposals, the bill also seeks to compel persons dealing with cryptos to maintain and share records of all activities relating to digital currency transactions.\n\n“A person who trades in digital currencies shall keep records of digital currency transactions, including purchases and sales, and pay taxes on any gains that are made from transactions in digital currencies in accordance with the applicable laws,” the bill reportedly states.",2022-11-23T17:00:08.000Z

She now sits on the board of directors at blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos.\n\nShe explained that both Bankman-Fried and Madoff proved adept at seducing sophisticated investors and regulators into ignoring red flags hiding in plain sight. FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last week and Bankman-Fried stepped down as the CEO.\n\n“Charming regulators and investors can distract them from digging in and seeing what’s really going on,” Bair described, elaborating:\n\nIt felt very Bernie Madoff-like in that way.\n\nMadoff ran the largest Ponzi scheme in history, worth about $64.8 billion. He promised investors high returns but rather than investing, he deposited their money into a bank account and paid, upon request, from existing and new investors’ funds. Convicted of fraud, money laundering, and other related crimes, he was sentenced to 150 years in federal prison. Madoff died in prison on April 14, last year, at the age of 82.\n\nBankman-Fried secretly transferred about $10 billion of customer funds from FTX to his other trading firm Alameda Research and reportedly used a “backdoor” to avoid triggering accounting red flags.\n\nFTX garnered its $32 billion valuation with investments from major companies and venture capital firms, including Blackrock, Softbank, and Sequoia. Bair commented:\n\nYou get this herd mentality where if all your peers and marquee names in venture capital are investing, you’ve got to, too. And that adds credibility with Washington policymakers. It all feeds on itself.\n\nThe former FDIC chair is not worried about the FTX implosion threatening the entire financial system the way Lehman Brothers did in 2008, noting that crypto is still a relatively small part of the broader economy and financial market.\n\nHowever, the crypto market remains largely unregulated, leaving investors vulnerable if something breaks. Bair stressed:\n\nIt’s time to settle on a regulatory regime for crypto and sort out who is regulating what because people are getting hurt.\n\nThe former regulator further urged investors to use caution and be skeptical. “If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,” she said.",2022-11-20T17:00:09.000Z

Warning of “cascading effects,” he stressed: “A lot of consumer confidence is shaken, and I think basically it sets us back a few years.”\n\nThe CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), shared his thoughts on the potential impact that the collapse of FTX has on the crypto industry Friday at a conference in Indonesia. FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Friday; Sam Bankman-Fried also stepped down as the CEO of the company.\n\nWhen the moderator at the conference compared the FTX fiasco to the 2008 financial crisis, Zhao commented: “I think that’s probably an accurate analogy.” The Binance chief added:\n\nWith this type of event happening, it’s devastating for the industry. A lot of consumer confidence is shaken, and I think basically it sets us back a few years.\n\nIn addition, CZ opined: “With FTX going down, we will see cascading effects. Especially for those close to the FTX ecosystem, they will be negatively affected.”\n\nZhao expects the crypto industry will likely face more regulatory scrutiny focusing on capital requirements and handling of deposits. However, he noted that it is “probably a good thing, to be honest.”\n\nFollowing the collapse of FTX, the White House and several U.S. lawmakers have called for proper cryptocurrency regulation. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), for example, said that crypto needs “more aggressive enforcement,” adding that she will keep pushing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to “enforce the law.”\n\nBinance was considering acquiring FTX and providing liquidity. However, after performing due diligence, the crypto exchange decided not to proceed with the acquisition, stating: “As a result of corporate due diligence, as well as the latest news reports regarding mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations, we have decided that we will not pursue the potential acquisition of FTX.”\n\nThe Binance boss believes that the crypto industry will eventually bounce back, emphasizing at the conference in Indonesia: “The market will heal itself.”\n\nZhao also tweeted Sunday:\n\nIt may take some effort, but what else have we got to do?

The partnership encompasses the use of YGG resources to promote gaming projects built on top of the Oasys ecosystem, giving developers from all over the world an opportunity to get into Japan’s gaming market.\n\nOasys, a gamefi-oriented blockchain (with “gamefi” meaning basically the intersection of gaming and finance), is aiming to leverage its stance as a Japan-based project to offer resources for foreign developers to access this significant gaming market. On Nov. 2, the company announced a partnership with YGG, a gaming guild, that will allow products built using Oasys’ services to enjoy specific marketing and promotional help to improve the performance of these products in Japan.\n\nThe goal of Oasys is to grow the blockchain gaming ecosystem in Japan, which is one of the leading gaming markets in the world. According to the “Global Markets Report 2021,” made by Newzoo, Japan is currently the third largest market in gaming revenue around the world, behind China and the U.S. The sector registered gaming revenues of $22.9 billion in 2021, with 75.62 million players actively enjoying these experiences.\n\nOasys founder and CEO Daiki Moriyama reinforced the importance of Japan as part of the future of blockchain gaming. On this, he stated:\n\nAs the third largest gaming market in the world, Japan’s gaming credentials are well-established. With the government continuing to invest in building the local Web3 infrastructure, there is now tremendous potential for blockchain gaming to grow globally with Japan serving as a launchpad.\n\nOasys wants to capitalize on the difficulties that foreign companies face when trying to enter the Japanese market. Around 99% of the games played in Japan are local, and while the revenue made is huge, only 15% goes to foreign companies. This is because localization is more than just language translation, and can involve changes in games to better approach the Japanese user base.\n\nTetsuya Fujiwara, a co-founder of YGG Japan, seems positive about what YGG can offer to developers outside of Japan through this alliance. Fujiwara believes that YGG will help global developers to overcome the hurdles that the market presents by using its knowledge of gaming.

Our partnership with Oasys will help us to reach even more developers that are building compelling blockchain games of the future.\n\nThis partnership comes after Oasys announced it was launching phase one of its mainnet on Oct. 25, with the support of companies like Bandai Namco, Square Enix, Ubisoft, and Sega.",2022-11-08T17:00:16.000Z

To ensure the principles are adhered to, Gang claimed his institution’s role will be limited to managing the e-CNY operating system as well as handling cross-border transactions.\n\nAlso, in his Oct.31 remarks to Hong Kong Fintech Week 2022 participants, Gang insisted the PBOC “does not handle personal transaction information.” This task as well as the provision of e-CNY exchange services and circulation of the digital currency is handled by the so-called “designated operating institutions.”\n\nMeanwhile, the PBOC governor appeared to use his speech, which was delivered in his native language, to reiterate the bank’s commitment to the law. He said:\n\n“The People’s Bank of China strictly follows relevant laws and regulations on consumer privacy protection and ensures the security of personal information through advanced technical means and strict management mechanisms. Transaction data is encrypted and stored. The bank anonymizes personal sensitive information, which is not visible to third parties.

Ad growth in the third quarter fell to a low seen only once in almost a decade, the tech company revealed this week.\n\nOnline advertising giant Google has partially blamed a slowdown in revenue growth on decreasing ad spending by financial firms, including those working with crypto assets. During parent company Alphabet’s earnings call on Tuesday, Google’s Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler admitted to witnessing reduced search spending during the third-quarter and elaborated:\n\nFor example in financial services, we saw a pullback in the insurance, loan, mortgage, and crypto subcategories.\n\nIn a report quoting the executive, CNBC noted that the with an overall ad growth of 6%, the three-month period was Google’s weakest among all quarters since 2013, with only one exception, at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nYoutube’s ad revenue also shrank on annual basis, with Google CEO Sundar Pichai referring to the challenging macro climate’s impact on the ad business.\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BCH) and ethereum (ETH) lost nearly 60% of their value in 2022, compared to their all-time highs. The crypto industry has since seen a string of bankruptcies of hedge funds and lenders, including Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, and Three Arrows Capital, as well as downsizing in companies such as Blockchain and Crypto.\n\nLeading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase cut its workforce by 18% and its stock is down 70% this year, after the company went public in 2021. Google announced a partnership with the crypto trading platform in the third quarter of this year.\n\nEarlier in October, Google unveiled it will rely on Coinbase to allow customers to pay for its cloud services with cryptocurrencies in 2023, an indication of the tech giant’s hopes that the crypto winter will be short.

The remarks by the economist came just days after the currency’s exchange rate reportedly touched a new low of just under 750 naira for every U.S. dollar on the parallel market.\n\nAccording to a Bank of America economist, Tatonga Rusike, the Nigerian currency, which has officially stayed below the 450:1 mark since May 2021, is overvalued by 20% and he expects it to be devalued by as much in 2023. In his October 18 note to clients, Rusike reportedly said the bank came to this conclusion after examining indicators like the central bank’s real effective exchange rate and the widely used parallel market exchange rate.\n\nIn addition to using the two exchange rates, the bank also used its own currency fair value analysis to determine the extent of the naira’s overvaluation. Meanwhile, Rusike’s devaluation comments came just days after the currency’s exchange rate reportedly touched a new low of just under 750 naira for every U.S. dollar on the parallel market.\n\nBefore that, Bitcoin News reported on October 3 that the naira versus the dollar exchange rate had slipped to its then-all-time low of 735 for every dollar. In the past, Nigerian monetary authorities have laid the blame for the currency’s woes on forex speculators. Ongoing shortages of the key resource are also seen as another factor contributing to the naira’s freefall.\n\nJust like other Nigerian experts, Rusike is adamant that the naira will likely continue to weaken against the U.S. dollar, which has been gaining ground versus other global currencies. The economist said:\n\nWe see scope for it to weaken by an equivalent amount over the next six-nine months, taking it to as high as 520 per USD.\n\nNigeria’s statistician-general, Prince Semiu Adeyemi, recently suggested that the naira’s continuing free-fall is partly the reason why the country’s inflation rate marginally rose from 20.52% in August to 20.77% in September.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank of America has warned that if the gap between the official exchange and parallel market rate is not narrowed, this could lead to a greater “likelihood of increasing excess demand for foreign currency on the parallel market.”",2022-10-21T17:00:07.000Z

With less than three months left in 2022, Finder’s panelists predict that ethereum will drop as low as $963 per unit this year, and they also expect ethereum to end the year at $1,377 per unit.\n\nOn October 11, 2022, Finder, the product and price comparison web portal, published a new prediction survey that discusses the second-leading crypto asset ethereum (ETH). Bitcoin News reported on Finder’s last ether prediction poll which said ether’s value could bottom out at $675 per coin by the year’s end. The latest ethereum Finder’s survey leverages 55 fintech and crypto experts who predict a different outcome regarding ether’s future value.\n\nFor instance, 46% of the latest survey’s panelists believe ETH is undervalued but will drop as low as $963 per unit this year. The panelists also believe that after the $963 bottom is in, ether will end 2022 at $1,377 per unit. 31% of the surveyed experts think ethereum is currently fairly priced and 23% of Finder’s panelists think ETH is overpriced. By 2025, the panelists expect ETH to reach $5,154 per ether and by 2030, the experts think ETH will tap $11,727 per unit.\n\nThomson Reuters technologist and futurist, Joseph Raczynski, predicts ETH will reach $1,700 by the end of 2022.\n\n“Ethereum has fallen in value, though one could argue, Ethereum is actually more valuable and secure now. The narrative is also way better on the environmental impact, reducing electricity consumption by over 99%,” Raczynski remarked in Finder’s latest ether prediction study.\n\nSEBA Bank head of research Yves Longchamp is one of the 31% of panelists that believe ether is fairly priced at the moment. “The Ethereum ecosystem is undergoing a series of upgrades,” Longchamp wrote. “All are intended to lead the Ethereum network to greater scalability, transaction speed, and cost efficiency. Once complete, The Merge will set up Ethereum to be a global settlement layer, fit for building powerful decentralized applications.”\n\nBoston Trading Co. CFO Jeremy Britton detailed during the survey that even though Ethereum has won points with governments and environmentalists, the protocol “lacks the decentralization for which crypto was intended.” Tommy Honan, the head of strategic partnerships at Swyftx has a similar opinion. Honan says the validator concentration within the ETH network is concerning, and it can give bitcoin (BTC) an advantage.\n\n“Early statistics on concentration of staking validators is quite concerning, given 5 or so based in the U.S. account for around 64% of staked ETH globally,” Honan explained. “Although I believe this will level out over time, it means The Merge event has further contributed to the centralisation of Ethereum, another card for the Bitcoin maximalists to hold over its closest rival.”\n\n56% of Finder’s panelists, however, do not think the blockchain will ever be “monopolized by a single player,” and 22% think that it’s likely a single player could monopolize the ETH network. 22% responded that they are “unsure” about whether or not ETH will be ruled by centralized entities in the future.",2022-10-12T17:00:08.000Z

The numbers, which come directly from the Brazilian Tax Authority (RFB), show that more and more institutions are eager to purchase cryptocurrency, and also indicate that the most significant volumes are moved using Tether’s stablecoin usdt.\n\nInstitutions are attracted to holding crypto in Latam countries due to their economies’ specific problems. Recently, the Brazilian Tax Authority (RFB) registered a record increase in the number of these institutions declaring ownership of some kind of cryptocurrency. The numbers, that correspond to August’s statements, show that more than 12,000 companies in Brazil acknowledge holding crypto as part of their treasury.\n\nThis indicator rose from the number of companies that declared having crypto in July (11,360). However, the statements of individuals did register a slowdown when compared to July, registering 35,000 statements less in August. However, this indicator is still high, with more than 1,300,000 individuals declaring they have some kind of crypto as part of their assets.\n\nEach month the Brazilian Tax Authority (RFB) informs the market about movements in the number of mandatory statements regarding the ownership of crypto to give a glimpse into the evolution and direction of the market.\n\nUSDT, the dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Tether, is one of the tokens most used in the country, at least when it comes to value moved. More than $1.4 billion was moved using USDT across 79,836 operations in August, with an average amount of almost $18,000 per transaction.\n\nHowever, bitcoin beat USDT when comparing the number of transactions made in the same period. During August, more than 2.1 million transactions were made using BTC. However, the amount of money involved was far less, reaching an average amount of close to $130 per transaction. BRZ, the first Brazilian real-pegged stablecoin, also registered significant levels of movement, alongside ETH and USDC, yet another dollar-pegged stablecoin.\n\nThese numbers show that the cryptocurrency market is growing in the country at an accelerated rate, given that in July, the Brazilian Tax Authority also registered a record number of individual cryptocurrency ownership statements. This has caused many fintech companies like Picpay and Nubank, and even traditional banks such as Santander, to announce their intention to include cryptocurrency services as part of their portfolio.",2022-10-09T17:00:07.000Z

Citing Korean publication News1, journalist Colin Wu tweeted Wednesday:\n\nSouth Korean prosecutors have frozen $39.66 million of crypto assets, including BTC, owned by Do Kwon through two exchanges.

However, the organization denied the allegation, insisting that it “hasn’t created any new wallets or moved BTC or other tokens held by LFG since May 2022.”\n\nFollowing the news of the prosecutors freezing $39.66 million in crypto belonging to him, Kwon took to Twitter to deny that the frozen funds are his. “I don’t get the motivation behind spreading this falsehood – muscle flexing?

Moreover, Interpol has issued a Red Notice for him. “A Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action,” Interpol’s website details, adding that “Red Notices are issued for fugitives wanted either for prosecution or to serve a sentence.”\n\nThe Luna founder’s whereabouts are currently unknown.

The IMF also released a CBDC handbook as a reference guide for policymakers and experts at central banks and ministries of finance around the world.\n\nThe IMF chief detailed:\n\n💬 CBDCs can replace cash which is costly to distribute in island economies. They can offer resilience in more advanced economies. And they can improve financial inclusion where few hold bank accounts. CBDCs would offer a safe and low-cost alternative. They would also offer a bridge to go between private monies and a yardstick to measure their value, just like cash today which we can withdraw from our banks.\n\n➡️ Georgieva explained that many countries “are developing regulation to guide digital money developments.” However, she admitted: “We have not yet reached land. There is so much more space for innovation and so much uncertainty over use-cases.” Citing various benefits of central bank digital currencies, the head of the IMF opined: “In some countries, the case seems dim today, but even they should remain open to potentially deploy CBDCs tomorrow.”\n\n🪖 Georgieva also said that artificial intelligence (AI) “could amplify some of the benefits of CBDCs.” She noted: “It could improve financial inclusion by providing rapid, accurate credit scoring based on various data. It could provide personalized support to people with low financial literacy.” However, the IMF chief continued: “To be sure, we need to protect personal privacy and data security, and avoid embedded biases so we don’t perpetuate inequality but aim to reduce it.

Although Reddit has expunged the Community Points FAQ page, it remains accessible through archived snapshots.\n\n⚫️ Initially brought to light by Techcrunch, the news garnered further clarity as Reddit’s Director of Consumer and Product Communications, Tim Rathschmidt, explained the rationale behind shelving the venture. “Though we saw some future opportunities for Community Points, the resourcing needed was unfortunately too high to justify,” Rathschmidt told Techcrunch contributor Morgan Sung. The Reddit executive also noted that the regulatory climate has played a part in the reasoning.\n\n❕ Following the dissemination of the news across the crypto community and Reddit, two Community Points tokens, MOON and BRICK, took a nosedive. The r/cryptocurrency coin MOON tumbled 84% while the r/fortnite token shrunk nearly 40% in value. \n\n💬 “Terrible move that will make Reddit very untrustworthy going on, you just ruined a lot of dreams [and] cost people an insane amount of time and money that they invested just so you could say that your trial was cool [and] you got some info from it all?” another person wrote. Within the same thread.\n\n➡️ Since their inception in 2021, Reddit’s blockchain-fueled Community Points tokens had woven a fabric of expectation among Redditors, many of whom envisioned the project sailing smoothly for several more years. A handful of Redditors have articulated their resolve to uphold these projects independently, without Reddit’s patronage. As of now, the MOON tokens ecosystem has a total of 126,013,438 tokens shared among 211,104 unique holders.",2023-10-19T16:59:01.000Z

Carlson stated that sanctions on Russia and the weaponization of the U.S. dollar are partly to blame for the developments.\n\nTucker Carlson, host of Fox News and the “Tucker Carlson Tonight” show, touched on the recent moves countries have been making to distance themselves from using the U.S. dollar as a reserve and settlement currency. According to Carlson, the sanctions the U.S. government enacted against Russia — as part of the deterrence effort against the Russia-Ukraine conflict — are in part to blame for the recent de-dollarization efforts at a global scale.\n\nCarlson explained that the sanctions did not result in the fall of the Russian economy due to its key traits, having its base in exports of products needed by other countries. He stated:\n\n🗣️Unlike the U.S., Russia does not have a late-stage financial economy. Russian oligarchs do not get rich from credit default swaps. They get rich by selling actual things that people need in order to live: oil, gas, iron, fertilizer, coal, wheat.\n\nHowever, these sanctions that froze billions in funds owned by the Russian central bank and other Russian oligarchs supposedly alerted other countries about the danger of holding reserves in U.S. dollars.\n\nCarlson argued that as a result of these deterrence-led movements, other large economies started seeing the dollar as a liability that could be turned on them.\n\nHe explained:\n\nSmart foreigners started to dump the U.S. dollar. Why? Because the U.S. dollar was no longer a reliable store of value. Suddenly it was a political weapon that could be wielded at will against anyone who held it.",2023-04-08T13:45:53.000Z

Von Greyerz states that in the face of an economy with no buyers, the only hedge will be tangible assets, including gold and silver.\n\nHe believes that the 2008 market collapse, the subprime mortgage crisis, the wild swing in the rates of treasuries, and the inflation boom have all been produced by the current central banking system.

According to a report, the collapse of crypto exchanges like FTX prompted Taiwanese officials to seek ways of protecting users against similar events should they recur.\n\n🟢According to Taiwanese government officials, the country’s financial sector regulator — the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) — is set to become the body overseeing and regulating the country’s virtual currency industry. As per a CNA report, an announcement to this effect is set to be made in late March or early April.\n\n🟢Explaining the rationale behind the government’s decision to appoint FSC as the body that oversees virtual assets in Taiwan, the report suggested that FTX’s collapse played a part in convincing officials to look for ways of protecting users in the event of another major collapse.

Circle said the move is part of the company’s plan to allocate shares of the stablecoin’s denominated reserves to minority-owned depository institutions (MDIs) and community banks across the United States.\n\nThe digital currency firm Circle has announced that Atlanta-based Citizens Trust Bank, founded in 1947, will hold $65 million in usd coin (USDC) reserves. This move follows a series of announcements where Circle allocated funds to various U.S.-based financial institutions over the past year. For example, Circle stated on April 1, 2022, that BNY Mellon would hold USDC reserves, and in June, the Boston-based company announced that New York Community Bancorp would hold USDC reserves.\n\n🟢Additionally, Circle announced last November that it is working with Blackrock to manage a portion of the USDC reserves in a fund registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). “The opportunity to maintain a portion of Circle’s growing USDC reserves means we are strengthening our balance sheet and becoming a key part of fast-growing new markets,” Cynthia N. Day, the president and chief executive officer of Citizens Trust Bank said in a statement. Circle also announced on Friday that it will collaborate with Citizens Trust Bank to enhance financial literacy initiatives.\n\nThe company stated that it is developing plans to expand programming into the community through Atlanta’s historic HBCUs and local schools, with a launch event slated for this summer and a $100K seed grant from Circle. As of Feb. 24, 2023, Circle’s stablecoin USDC has an overall valuation of $42.66 billion and is the second-largest U.S. dollar-pegged cryptocurrency asset in terms of market capitalization.",2023-02-25T17:40:12.000Z

The ongoing strike by banks demanding the passage of capital control legislation has compounded matters for residents.\n\nAccording to several local media reports, Lebanon’s currency recently plunged to a new all-time low of 80,000 per U.S. dollar on the unofficial foreign exchange market. The Lebanese pound’s fall on the parallel market came less than a month after it was devalued by more than 90% on the official market.\n\nAlthough the currency’s devaluation from 1,507 to 15,000 per dollar was seen as monetary authorities’ attempt to unify the pound’s multiple exchange rates, some experts have argued that the new official exchange rate is pegged way below the rates where most trade takes place.\n\n➖The currency’s latest plunge meanwhile has piled more misery on Lebanese residents who have already seen the country’s high inflation rate decimate their pound-denominated savings. \n\nTo compound matters for residents, the country’s banks recently went on strike and are demanding the passage of capital control laws that restrict foreign and local currency withdrawals. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), which reached a bailout deal with the Lebanese government in April 2022, has reportedly asked for capital control reforms to be carried out before it releases funding.\n\nHowever, in response to the move by banks as well as the pound’s latest plunge, Lebanese residents reportedly attacked the closed banking outlets. In one video shared on social media, angry Lebanese protesters are seen attempting to set on fire the home of the president of the Association of Lebanese Banks.\n\nOn Twitter, some users shared pictures and videos of burning bank buildings while crypto enthusiasts used the Lebanese banks’ ability to block clients’ access to funds to highlight the risks of using a digital currency issued by central banks.",2023-02-22T17:00:11.000Z

Kiyosaki stressed that gold, silver, and bitcoin are the best investments for “unstable times.”\n\nThe author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, gave some more investment advice this week. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.\n\nKiyosaki tweeted Friday:\n\nFor years, I have been saying, ‘Saving money & investing in a well-diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, mutual funds & ETFs is risky advice.’ Today very risky advice. I still believe gold, silver, bitcoin best for unstable times, although prices will go up and down.\n\nThe famous author previously said: “I do not love stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs.” However, he noted that investors should invest in what they love. In April last year, he said bonds are “the riskiest investment” in a global meltdown. “Tragically, rookie investors follow rookie advice of 60 (stocks) 40 (bonds) mix,” he opined, recommending investors buy gold, silver, and bitcoin “as insurance against morons running the world.” He also said in July last year: “I do not touch paper gold or silver ETFs. I only want real gold or silver coins.”\n\nAs for mutual funds, Kiyosaki has said for several years: “I just don’t like mutual funds. I think they’re a rip-off.” He explained in 2019: “Financial planners are henchmen for banks and mutual funds. They sell you their products, take your money, charge you fees, and use your money to get richer.”\n\nMany people on Twitter disagreed with Kiyosaki, telling him that a well-diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs is a lot less risky than investing in gold, silver, and bitcoin. Some accused the famous author of pumping BTC for his personal gain.\n\nKiyosaki has been recommending gold, silver, and BTC for quite some time. He said last December that owners of the three investments will get richer when the Federal Reserve pivots and prints trillions of dollars. He predicted that by 2025, gold will be at $5,000, silver at $500, and bitcoin at $500,000. In addition, he expects gold to soar to $3,800 and silver to rise to $75 this year. Kiyosaki previously explained that he is a bitcoin investor, not a trader, so he gets excited whenever BTC hits a new bottom.\n\nMoreover, the renowned author has repeatedly said that he does not trust the Biden administration, the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, or Wall Street. He has warned many times that the Fed is destroying the economy and the U.S. dollar. In October 2021, he tweeted: “I love bitcoin because I do not trust Fed, Treasury, or Wall Street.” The Rich Dad Poor Dad author recently cautioned that “everything will crash” and a depression is possible. In January, he said we are in a global recession, warning of soaring bankruptcies, unemployment, and homelessness.",2023-02-19T17:00:17.000Z

The decision comes after judge John Dorsey postponed the ruling last week, citing concerns that the examiner could cost creditors tens of millions of dollars.\n\nIn the latest filing in the FTX bankruptcy case docket, judge John Dorsey has denied the appointment of an independent examiner. Dorsey stated that the current team, led by FTX CEO John J. Ray III, is “highly qualified” to handle the bankruptcy proceedings independently. The decision overrides the U.S. Trustee’s request to hire an independent examiner, which was said to be mandated by Congress.\n\nThe judge presiding over the FTX bankruptcy case stressed, however, that he had “no doubt that appointing an examiner would not be in the best interest of the creditors.” According to estimates, current management claimed that expenses for an independent examiner could reach between $90 million and $100 million. “Every dollar spent on administrative expenses in these cases is $1 less for the creditors,” Dorsey stated during the hearing, agreeing that an examiner could be very costly.\n\nSince Dec. 1, 2022, an attorney for the U.S. Trustee, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), has been attempting to appoint an examiner to the FTX case in the Delaware bankruptcy court. During the case, a representative for the Trustee argued that the appointment of an independent examiner was mandated by Congress and no longer within Dorsey’s authority.\n\nThe Trustee’s argument was supported by a letter from four bipartisan U.S. senators insisting that an independent examiner be appointed. However, the decision by the Delaware bankruptcy judge emphasizes that his court’s authority has overruled the government’s request.",2023-02-16T17:00:18.000Z

The statements, made in the wake of the $30 million settlement that Kraken, another U.S.-based crypto exchange, completed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also criticize the institution’s approach to the issue.\n\nCoinbase, one of the leading U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges, has published a blog post differentiating its staking-as-a-service program from others in the market, and clarifying that, for the institution, this kind of service does not constitute a security offering.\n\nIn a blog post published on February 10, Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of the company, states how getting this point wrong in regulation may affect the whole crypto industry in the country. The article explains the stance of the company on the issue, stating:\n\nStaking is not a security under the US Securities Act, nor under the Howey test. Trying to superimpose securities law onto a process like staking doesn’t help consumers at all and instead imposes unnecessarily aggressive mandates that will prevent US consumers from accessing basic crypto services.\n\nFurthermore, Grewal also criticized the way that the U.S. SEC is handling cryptocurrency regulation, explaining that regulation by enforcement is a “poor substitute” to actual rulemaking.\n\nThe position of Coinbase seems to directly oppose the stance that the U.S. SEC has taken when it comes to centralized platforms offering cryptocurrency staking services. On Feb. 9, the institution completed a $30 million settlement with Kraken, another cryptocurrency exchange, for the unregistered sale and offer of these services to its customers.\n\nGary Gensler, chairman of the SEC, has hinted at more actions of this kind coming for other players in the industry, stating that these companies need to disclose the risk associated with such activities to their customers. On Feb. 10, in an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Gensler stated:\n\nOther platforms should take note of this, and seek to come into compliance, do the proper disclosures, registration and alike.\n\nCoinbase offers cryptocurrency staking programs for different cryptocurrencies as part of its service portfolio and collects a flat fee for operating these services. In a recent report, JPMorgan predicted that new staking funds coming to Ethereum after the upcoming Shanghai upgrade are likely to go to decentralized platforms like Lido due to the different benefits they offer compared to centralized providers.",2023-02-13T17:00:22.000Z

Accordingly, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is adjusting withdrawal fees.\n\nWithdrawal charges increasing on Binance\n\nThe decision by Binance to increase the withdrawal cost comes in response to Proposal 83, which asked for the Tron community’s approval to switch smart contracts’ energy charge models from static to dynamic.\n\nHowever, following an announcement on Feb. 10, Binance will modify withdrawal fees on the Tron Network in light of Proposal 83, which the community approved last month.\n\nProposal 83 introduces a system to execute dynamic energy regulation in contracts provided on the Tron Network to balance energy allocation among contracts. Depending on the resources used during execution, a contract’s energy consumption will change dynamically.\n\nCurrently, a few low-value or even malicious contracts account for around 85% of the CPU execution time on the Tron network. As a result, the dynamic energy model raises transaction costs for fraudulent and low-value transactions while having no impact on other dApps.\n\nStablecoins like USDT, USDC, and TUSD have a 2.6 percent withdrawal charge, which has more than doubled. The withdrawal fee for BUSD stablecoin has been adjusted from 0.8 BUSD to 2.2 BUSD.\n\nMeanwhile, to withdraw TRX, users will have to pay 15 TRX, up from 1 TRX in the previous fee regime. Users who withdraw Tron tokens like BTTC, JST, NFT, SUN, and WIN will pay withdrawal fees equal to 40 TRX.\n\nThe community has proposed the dynamic energy model to adjust the contract’s future energy consumption in light of the contract’s actual energy consumption, or TIP-491.\n\nThis strategy will prevent the over-concentration of network resources on a select few contracts and result in a more sensible distribution of energy resources along the chain.\n\nThe Binance wallet for the Tron Network was maintained for two hours, five days before this announcement was made.\n\nWould this affect Tron Network’s onchain activity and trading?\n\nThe amount of trading in crypto tokens on the Tron network could be impacted by increased withdrawal costs. The prices might also be affected, most certainly.\n\nCrypto Twitter is disappointed that Tron is moving away from its goal of doing away with fees and making things easier.\n\nThe price of TRX is trading at $0.06308, down more than 3% in the last 24 hours.",2023-02-12T10:30:00.000Z

Coinkite details that the battery-powered device utilizes the same security model as the Coldcard Mk4.\n\nOver the past three months, companies have unveiled new hardware wallets for securely storing cryptocurrency assets. In Dec. 2022, Ledger announced the launch of Stax, designed by iPod creator Tony Fadell. The following month, decentralized exchange (dex) aggregation service 1inch Network disclosed its plans to launch a hardware wallet.\n\nThis month, Coinkite announced the launch of the “higher-end” Coldcard bitcoin signing device and the firm is currently accepting pre-order requests. The new Coldcard Q1 is a battery-powered machine that doesn’t require a connection to a desktop or power source. It boasts a 320×240 pixel LCD screen, which is approximately four times larger than the Coldcard Mk4‘s screen. The new Coldcard also includes a QWERTY keyboard and built-in QR code scanner with LED illumination.\n\nThe device has two MicroSD slots and near-field communication (NFC) capabilities, like the Coldcard Mk4. According to Coinkite’s documentation, the USB and NFC data can be “irreversibly blocked.” Coinkite details the QWERTY keyboard makes the entering of BIP-39 passphrases easier, and the triple-A batteries provide air-gapped resilience. Coinkite notes that all features of the Mk4 are present on the Q1, but many are easier to access due to dedicated keys.\n\n“For example, the dedicated ‘QR’ key lets you view many values as a QR code ready to be imported into your phone. Same for the dedicated ‘NFC’ key which triggers NFC export/import based on context,” Coinkite notes.\n\nThe Coldcard Mk4 costs $147.94 per unit, while the Q1 is priced at $199.99 per unit on the Coinkite website. Customers who pay with bitcoin (BTC) receive a 5% discount with a promotional code highlighted on the site. The competition in the market of manufacturing bitcoin hardware devices is certainly heating up with a new hardware wallet being launched every month in the last three months.",2023-02-10T17:00:11.000Z

An idea that aims to combat climate change and misinformation about energy solutions. Christensen is asking for 20,000 MKR tokens to move forward with the idea. The draft of the Maker Constitution was criticized on social media, with one person comparing Christensen’s idea to the Effective Altruism movement, which is backed by the controversial FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nA recent Makerdao Maker Improvement Proposal (MIP) by co-founder Rune Christensen proposes using 20,000 makerdao (MKR) tokens to fund a Scientific Sustainability Fund. According to Christensen, “Scientific Sustainability is a core principle of the Maker Constitution that recognizes the unique critical relationship between financial infrastructure and the global environmental risks of climate change,” This statement was made in a post on the Makerdao forum.\n\nChristensen is a staunch climate change activist that wants the fund to combat “misinformation about energy solutions that have proven, real life track records of achieving scalable decarbonization.” At the time of writing, 20,000 makerdao (MKR) tokens is roughly around $14 million using today’s exchange rates.\n\nAlthough Christensen believes the science of climate change is settled, there are still those who deny its existence and many people insist that there is “no climate disaster.” Some crypto advocates have mocked Christensen’s plan, with one calling the proposal “trash” and its advocates “thieves destroying value for MKR holders.” Another individual questioned the use of a stablecoin project to combat climate change.\n\nOne person commented that it “looks like Rune has gone full Effective Altruism,” referring to the movement promoted by the former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.

The increase in budget receipts has been attributed to the licensing regime and the introduction of fees for crypto companies.\n\nLicensed crypto firms have paid 3.5 billion Uzbekistani som (more than $310,000) to the budget in the course of 2022, Uzbekistan’s regulatory authority responsible for the oversight in the sector revealed during a press conference, quoted by the crypto news outlet Forklog.\n\nAt the briefing, the National Agency of Perspective Projects (NAPP), a body subordinated to the president, announced the results of its activities. Officials said that the government has been able to collect the money thanks to the revamped licensing system and the imposing of fees for businesses working with digital assets.\n\nFive crypto platforms are currently authorized to legally operate in the country and they have paid the said total. These are the state-controlled exchange Uznex and four smaller exchanges – Crypto Trade NET, Crypto Market, Crypto Express, and Coinpay.\n\nSince October, crypto service providers in Uzbekistan are required to pay fixed monthly fees for their activities. These range between over $10,000 for cryptocurrency exchanges like Uznex and around $500 for the smaller trading platforms, also referred to as “crypto shops.”\n\nAt the same time, operations of individuals and organizations related to crypto transactions are subject to taxation in the Central Asian nation, even when carried out by non-residents and companies based in other jurisdictions, according to the current law.\n\nHowever, the government in Tashkent has previously warned Uzbekistan’s citizens to avoid unlicensed exchange services. In August 2022, it tried to restrict access to online trading sites based outside the country. Uzbekistanis were allowed to buy and sell coins on domestic exchanges in November, 2021.\n\nThe NAPP also noted that 80% of the fees paid by the licensed crypto firms go to the state budget, while the remaining 20% are transferred to its own accounts. In late June, 2022, the agency presented registration requirements for miners who are relieved from taxation as well.

Devere found that among its millionaire clients with between $1 million and $5 million of investable assets, 82% have sought advice about investing in cryptocurrencies. Without providing additional details, the asset management firm wrote:\n\nEight out of 10 high net worth (HNW) individuals have asked their financial advisers about including cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, into their portfolios over the last 12 months — despite the market experiencing a difficult year in 2022.\n\n“In 2022, the crypto market delivered its worst performance since 2018, with bitcoin, the headline-grabbing market leader, falling about 75% during the year,” Devere Group CEO Nigel Green commented. He explained that the crypto price drops resulted from investors reducing “their exposure to risk-on assets, including stocks and crypto, due to heightened concerns about inflation and slower economic growth.”\n\nHowever, the executive pointed out that despite the crypto winter, high net worth investors “were consistently seeking advice from their financial advisers about including digital currencies into their portfolios.” Green stressed: “Interestingly, this typically more conservative group was not deterred by the bear market and adverse market conditions. Instead, they were looking to either start including or increasing their exposure to crypto.”\n\nThe Devere executive opined:\n\nThis suggests that these high net worth clients are increasingly aware of the inherent characteristics of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which has the core values of being digital, global, borderless, decentralized and tamper-proof.\n\n“Wealthy investors understand that digital currencies are the future of money, and they don’t want to be left in the past,” he further said.\n\n“Bitcoin is on track for its best January since 2013 based on hopes that inflation has peaked, monetary policies become more favorable, and the various crypto-sector crises, including high-profile bankruptcies, are now in the rear-view mirror,” the Devere executive continued.\n\nNoting that BTC is up about 40% so far this year, Green said the crypto’s performance “will not go unnoticed” by high net worth clients and “others who want to build wealth for the future.” He concluded:\n\nIf HNWs were expressing such huge interest in the 2022 bear market, as market conditions steadily improve, they’re going to be amongst the first to capitalise in the forthcoming bull run.\n\nGreen and Devere Group’s survey participants are not the only ones bullish about bitcoin. A recent survey published by Nickel Digital Asset Management found that institutional investors expect “a strong year ahead for bitcoin” and 65% of the institutional investors surveyed agree that BTC could reach $100,000.\n\nA different survey by Bitwise and Vettafi similarly found that “financial advisors remain highly engaged in crypto markets, with 15% allocating in client accounts and 90% receiving inbound questions from clients about the space.” Last month, global investment bank Goldman Sachs ranked bitcoin the best-performing asset this year.",2023-02-01T17:00:06.000Z

Warning of soaring bankruptcies, unemployment, and homelessness, he noted that there is good news for investors looking for “bargains.”\n\nThe author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, is back with more warnings about the U.S. economy and global recession. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.\n\nKiyosaki tweeted Saturday: “Q: What is worse than a great depression? A: a global recession.” He added:\n\nUnfortunately, we are in global recession. Hang on. Rough landing for world. Bad news. Bankruptcy, unemployment, homelessness soar. Retirements toast.\n\nHowever, the famed author pointed out there is good news for investors, elaborating: “Bargains [are] everywhere. Gold, silver, bitcoin priceless.”\n\nIn July last year, Kiyosaki cautioned that inflation may lead to greater depression, noting that real estate is crashing and layoffs are starting. He also warned about hyperinflation and depression in April, predicting that the U.S. dollar is about to implode. In May, he reiterated: “Bad news. Depression coming.”\n\nThe Rich Dad Poor Dad author is not the only one concerned about a global recession. In September last year, the World Bank said the risk of a global recession in 2023 is rising as central banks worldwide simultaneously hike interest rates in response to inflation. In addition, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned of a tough year ahead for the world economy.\n\nKiyosaki has regularly warned about the state of the U.S. economy while recommending investors buy gold, silver, and bitcoin. He often said that he does not trust the Biden Administration, the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and Wall Street. He stressed that the Fed and the Treasury are destroying the U.S. dollar.\n\nHe tweeted on Jan. 14 that bitcoin, gold, silver, and oil are moving up in price, noting: “Good news for those that know inflation is permanent … now systemic … not transitory. Bad news for the uninformed, poor, middle class … anyone who believes Biden cares about them and their families.”\n\nThe famous author said in December that bitcoin investors will get richer when the Federal Reserve pivots and prints trillions of dollars. He explained in November that he is a bitcoin investor, not a trader, so he gets excited when the price of BTC plunges. In September, he urged investors to get into crypto now before the biggest economic crash in the world happens.",2023-01-29T17:00:05.000Z

Klaus Schwab, chairman of the WEF, plans to leverage this representation of Davos to allow people and leaders to meet in virtual worlds and coordinate global collaboration efforts efficiently.\n\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) has announced the rollout of its own metaverse platform, dubbed the Global Collaboration Village. The digital world, designed to look like the actual town of Davos in which the organization meets once every year, will supposedly allow for more efficient collaboration between world leaders.\n\nAccording to Klaus Schwab, chairman of the organization, the WEF plans to leverage this new world as a way of turning Davos meetings, which usually last just a week, into a project that will allow for interviews and conversations between world leaders all year round.\n\nSchwab is optimistic about this, as the effect of the policies discussed at Davos might be amplified through constant feedback. “This could revolutionize global collaboration,” he told Time magazine.\n\nThe organization believes that meeting through avatars and digital representations might empower the creativity behind these meetings, compared to the video meetings that commonly occur during these events.\n\nThe technology that would power this metaverse representation of Davos would be provided by Microsoft and its Mesh suite, which extends the functionality of Teams, the popular business meeting software, to allow users to appear as 3D avatars. Mesh also has a specially designed app for VR headsets that allows for more interactivity with the metaverse worlds.\n\nThis level of immersion is key for the applications that the WEF aims to give these spaces, like showing the effect that certain measures could have, for example, in restoring ocean coral reefs. Kelly Ommundsen, head of the WEF metaverse project, stated the group is “trying to do things that can only happen in the metaverse—because if it’s better done in person or on paper, then it doesn’t make sense.”\n\nSchwab has already enlisted the collaboration and presence of several partners, including Meta and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), that will populate the village spaces with their projects. He expects some kind of resistance to this initiative, but also expects a heavier involvement of people from outside the organization. He explained:\n\nWe need new ways of international cooperation, which will allow us to involve many more people into our discussions.",2023-01-20T17:00:09.000Z

During the research phase, the central bank said it paid particular attention “to risks and controls associated with issuance, distribution, counterfeit and usage of currencies.”\n\nThe Bank of Tanzania (BOT) announced on Jan. 14 that it had “adopted a phased, cautious and risk-based approach to adoption of CBDC [central bank digital currency].” The bank also said it will continue with its efforts aimed at finding “a suitable and appropriate use and technology for issuance of Tanzanian shillings in digital form.”\n\nAccording to a statement on the bank’s website, the BOT said it chose a more cautious approach after spending months researching and exploring the pros and cons of issuing the digital currency. During this period, the BOT said it found that other central banks had adopted the same posture, while six countries had chosen to cancel their CBDC adoption “mainly due to structural and technological challenges in the implementation phase.”\n\nAs reported by Bitcoin.com News in May 2022, the Tanzanian central bank said it planned to launch its CBDC because this had become a trend among central banks. In addition, the bank said the digital currency would be “a safe[r] alternative because many people are being affected by cryptocurrency speculators.”\n\nHowever, fears the CBDC could disrupt the country’s financial system eventually forced the BOT, which signaled its readiness to launch in the first half of 2022, to adopt a more conservative approach.\n\nMeanwhile, during the research phase, the Tanzanian central bank revealed that it considered the type of CBDC to be issued, the models for issuance, the form of the digital currency, as well as the “degree of anonymity or traceability.” The statement also suggested the bank had given more attention to associated risks.\n\n“Particular attention also is paid to risks and controls associated with issuance, distribution, counterfeit and usage of currencies,” the central bank said.\n\nIn the statement, the BOT said once the research is complete, the Tanzanian public will be given information on the way forward and this will likely include a roadmap for the “transition to CBDC adoption.”",2023-01-17T17:00:16.000Z

The billionaire’s comments followed the collapse of crypto exchange FTX which wiped out billions of dollars of customer funds.\n\nShark Tank star and the owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, shared his thoughts on the next crypto implosion with The Street, published Friday. The billionaire said:\n\nI think the next possible implosion is the discovery and removal of wash trades on central exchanges.\n\n“There are supposedly tens of millions of dollars in trades and liquidity for tokens that have very little utilization,” Cuban emphasized. “I don’t see how they can be that liquid.”\n\nHowever, the Shark Tank star admitted: “I don’t have any specifics to offer to support my guess.”\n\nWash trading has long been a concern with cryptocurrency exchanges attempting to inflate their trading volumes. Wash trades are among the manipulative practices prohibited by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and regulators worldwide are increasingly cracking down on wash trading involving cryptocurrencies.\n\nKim Grauer, director of research at blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, said in September last year that wash trading in the crypto space is currently “a legal gray area that we’re all trying to figure out how this should be regulated and what’s illegal.”\n\nThe crypto industry is also suffering from the aftermath of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in November. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) has been charged with multiple counts of fraud. However, he has pleaded not guilty to those charges.\n\nCuban said in November that if he were Bankman-Fried, he would “be afraid of going to jail for a long time.” He stressed: “It sure sounds bad.” The billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks previously explained that recent blowups in the crypto space, including the FTX implosion, were “banking blowups,” rather than “crypto blowups.”\n\nThe Shark Tank star believes that bitcoin is a good investment; he called gold investors “dumb.” He also revealed that he invests in crypto because he expects smart contracts to “have a significant impact in creating valuable applications.”",2023-01-08T17:00:10.000Z

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the supply bottlenecks resulting from the war, are said to be among the factors that helped to drive up prices.\n\nIn 2022, Germany’s average inflation rate topped 7.9%, its highest since the 1990 reunification, the country’s statistical office has said. As per the German press agency’s Jan. 3 report, the 2022 rate is more than double the 3.1% seen in 2021.\n\nAccording to the report, rising energy and food prices were among the main drivers of inflation for several months. As expected, the German Federal Statistical Office (FSO) reportedly identified Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the ensuing supply bottlenecks, as two key factors that led to the record inflation rate.\n\n“Consumers in Germany had to pay 24.4% more for energy in December than a year earlier. Food prices rose by 20.7% within a year,” the agency’s report explained.\n\nDespite recording what has been described as the country’s worst overall inflation rate since the 7.6% seen in 1951, the FSO data suggest that the monthly rate had dropped to 8.6% in December 2022. Before that, the rate had averaged 10.4% and 10%, in October and November, respectively.\n\nTo minimize the impact of rising prices on the population, the German government is reportedly planning to pour out “billions in aid.” It also aims to achieve this by using “price brakes for electricity and gas.” According to the report, some economists are optimistic that such steps will help tame inflation in 2023.",2023-01-05T17:00:08.000Z

More recently, Pakistani politician Imran Khan‘s Instagram account was used to promote a giveaway scam featuring Musk, and the British Army‘s official Youtube and Twitter accounts were compromised in July to promote a bitcoin giveaway.\n\nO’Leary was recently slammed by the crypto community for defending former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. He was paid about $15 million to become the crypto exchange’s spokesperson. Following the FTX meltdown, O’Leary said Bankman-Fried is a brilliant crypto trader and he will back him again if he has another venture.",2022-12-30T17:00:12.000Z

Mike Kondoudis, a USPTO-licensed trademark attorney, noted in a tweet Friday that HSBC’s trademark applications indicate the bank’s plans for a number of digital products and services, including those related to the exchange and transfer of virtual currencies.\n\nHSBC’s crypto-related trademark applications were filed on Dec. 15; their serial numbers are 97718803 and 97718583. The bank described a wide range of products and services in its applications, including sending, receiving, converting, and storing digital currencies.\n\nThe trademark applications also detail several metaverse-related products and services, such as “facilitating secure payment transactions by electronic means in the metaverse,” “providing banking services in the metaverse,” and “providing processing of virtual credit card, virtual debit card, virtual prepaid card, and virtual payment card transactions in the metaverse.” HSBC also included a number of NFT services, such as “downloadable digital files authenticated by non-fungible tokens (NFTs).”\n\nHSBC joined the metaverse by partnering with blockchain virtual gaming platform The Sandbox in March. However, HSBC Group’s CEO, Noel Quinn, said in September that crypto is not in the bank’s future.\n\nAn increasing number of major corporations and financial services institutions have filed trademark applications covering a wide range of digital currency and metaverse products and services. For example, Visa, Paypal, and Western Union filed crypto-related trademark applications in October.

The objective behind this move is to help the brand attract and connect with younger audiences, as part of its digital push and growth marketing strategy.\n\nMany companies have started to put their products and their brands in the metaverse, considering it an important part of their marketing strategy. Samsung, one of the biggest electronics companies in the world, has recently revealed it is investing more than $35 million in metaverse initiatives directed at Latam customers.\n\nIn an article published on Dec. 20, Anita Caerols, director of marketing and corporate citizenship of Samsung Electronics Chile, explains the motivations behind this virtual reality push for the company. She stated:\n\nAt Samsung we believe that the metaverse is a concrete commitment to connect with young consumers. That is why we are investing more than US$35 million in initiatives that cover all of Latam.\n\nFurthermore, Caerols believes that fully immersive platforms are part of the future of marketing and that for digital natives, the current metaverse is a natural extension of social media platforms, making it a sensible field for Samsung to explore.\n\nThe focus Samsung is putting on the metaverse, and the amount of funds invested in this area, are justified by the marketing vision presented by the company. On this, Caerols explained:\n\nIf a business needs to speak and connect with young audiences, prospect current and future potential consumers, and engage with new influencers, it is imperative that it be in the metaverse starting now.\n\nIt is Gen Z and Gen Alpha, audiences that are more accustomed to these platforms, which are the ones Samsung wants to attract to its proposal and its products. According to a Linkedin study, 400 million users are currently dwelling on metaverse platforms every month, with 51% of them being 13 years old or less.\n\nSamsung’s interest in the virtual world is not new, and the company has already made different moves in order to be a part of some metaverse platforms.\n\nIn October, the company launched its “House of Sam” experience in Decentraland, allowing users to interact virtually with products of the company.\n\nIn July, Samsung also launched another metaverse experience on Roblox, called “Space Tycoon,” allowing users to be part of a space station where they can build Samsung products with raw materials.",2022-12-24T17:00:14.000Z

However, he acknowledged that banning crypto “is very difficult because it will go offshore and who knows how that will work.”\n\nU.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, talked about cryptocurrency in an interview with NBC Sunday.\n\nHe stated that the Treasury Department and all the different regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), need to get together and assess any possible action related to the cryptocurrency market. Referring to the SEC and CFTC, the senator said:\n\nWe want them to do what they need to do. At the same time, maybe banning it, although banning it is very difficult because it will go offshore and who knows how that will work.\n\nLast week, the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee held a hearing on the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The House Financial Services Committee also held a separate hearing on FTX a day prior.\n\nFTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11 and its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) has been arrested and is now in jail in the Bahamas. He and his crypto firm are facing several fraud charges brought against them by the U.S. government and regulators. The U.S. is seeking Bankman-Fried’s extradition. However, SBF told the Bahamas court Monday that he will make a decision only after he has seen all the indictments against him.\n\nThe senator from Ohio also said Sunday that the cryptocurrency market is a “complicated, unregulated pot of money” and the issue was much larger than FTX. “So we’ve got to do this right,” he stressed.\n\n“I’ve spent much of the last eight years and a half in this job as chair of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee,” Brown continued, elaborating:\n\nEducating my colleagues and trying to educate the public about crypto and the dangers that it presents to our security as a nation and the consumers that get hoodwinked by them.\n\nLast week, Senator Pat Toomey explained in his opening remarks at the Senate hearing on FTX that the crypto exchange’s fallout does not justify banning or “pausing” crypto. “Some of my colleagues have suggested pausing cryptocurrencies before we can address it. This is profoundly misguided, not to mention impossible. Short of enacting draconian, authoritarian policies, cryptocurrency cannot be stopped. If we tried, the technology would simply migrate offshore,” he warned.",2022-12-21T17:00:05.000Z

Cramer is a former hedge fund manager who co-founded Thestreet, a financial news and literacy website. He tweeted Friday:\n\nWhy are there no strategists who say that most crypto are worthless so sell them? Why can’t people in charge just admit that Binance has no real legitimacy after what happened to FTX?\n\nThe crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Nov. 11, and an estimated one million customers and investors lost billions of dollars from its collapse. Bankman-Fried has been arrested in the Bahamas and the U.S. government and several regulators have brought fraud charges against SBF and the crypto exchange.\n\nThe Mad Money host also compared Binance to the fantasy sports betting platform Draftkings, which is banned as illegal gambling in many countries and U.S. states. Cramer tweeted:\n\nI would trust my money more in Draftkings than I would Binance.\n\nOnly two days prior, Cramer cryptically asked his Twitter followers: “Do you feel as reassured by Binance as I do?” Many users on the social media platform responded to the Mad Money host, taunting that whatever company Cramer is against is likely to be a good buy.\n\nBitcoin developer and podcaster Matt Odell commented on Cramer’s Draftkings comparison: “I do not have to trust either company. Unlike you, I hold my wealth myself without trust. It is called bitcoin. Binance. Draftkings. Chase Bank. All require trust. As trust erodes throughout our institutions, the value prop of trust minimized money will become obvious to many.”\n\nCramer said on CNBC Thursday: “I think you should be negative on crypto. I’m negative on XRP, LTC, and DOGE because I haven’t been able to find anyone that takes them … It’s like $80 billion worth of non-Bitcoin that’s destined to be wiped out.” Last week, he advised investors to get out of crypto, emphasizing that “it’s never to too late to sell an awful position.” Following the FTX meltdown, Cramer called Bankman-Fried a pathological liar, a conman, and a clueless idiot.\n\nThe Mad Money host used to invest in bitcoin, ether, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) but sold all his crypto holdings last year. “I told you I sold my bitcoin and ethereum a long time ago … and used the proceeds to buy a very nice farm,” he recently shared. Cramer has been advising investors to avoid investing in speculative assets, including crypto, while the Federal Reserve continues to tighten the economy.",2022-12-18T17:00:06.000Z

The token rose for a second consecutive day, hitting a key price ceiling in the process. Cardano mainly consolidated on Wednesday, as prices fell from a recent high.\n\nSolana (SOL) was a notable gainer on Wednesday, as prices surged to a three-week high.\n\nFollowing a low of $13.61 on Tuesday, SOL/USD raced to an intraday high of $14.68 earlier in today’s session.\n\nAs a result, solana moved to its strongest point since November 26, which is the last time prices were trading above a key ceiling of $14.70.\n\nLooking at the chart, this resistance point has yet to be broken following today’s gains, with SOL trading at $14.67 as of writing.\n\nThe 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also rose, and is currently tracking at 48.36, however it also failed to break out of a resistance level.\n\nAs of writing, the index remains below a ceiling of 49.00, which appears to be the main obstacle in place, preventing any further surges.\n\nOn the other hand, cardano (ADA) moved away from a recent eight-day high, as price consolidated ahead of today’s FOMC meeting.\n\nADA/USD fell to a low of $0.3069 earlier in the day, which comes less than a day after hitting a peak at $0.3152.\n\nThis surge in price sent cardano to its strongest point since December 5, which is the last time price was above a ceiling of $0.3270.\n\nFrom the chart, it can be seen that today’s price consolidation began following a failed breakout of the 46.00 ceiling on the RSI indicator.\n\nCurrently, the index is tracking at 43.79, with momentum appearing to be heading for a floor at 37.60.\n\nShould price strength reach this point, it is likely that ADA will be trading close to the $0.3000 support level.",2022-12-15T17:00:10.000Z

We know what that looks like. And our trust-minimizing systems will be life rafts for the world.”\n\nMany people on Twitter agreed with Srinivasan, stating that bitcoin and decentralization are the answer.\n\nHowever, some disagreed, telling the entrepreneur that FTX is a fraud and a Ponzi scheme. “It’s not a preview of state failure. It has nothing to do with that. It’s simply fraud,” one wrote. “How can you equate a 32-year-old con man who had no controls, structure, systems, or board to the U.S. government?” another questioned. A third opined: “Comparing regulated banking industry to unregulated crypto exchange is misleading.”\n\nSrinivasan also commented on bitcoin as a hedge against inflation in another tweet on Saturday. The angel investor detailed:\n\nIt’s a hedge against hyperinflation, monetary debasement, bank freezes, and wealth seizure.

According to Ruth Foxe Blader, partner at Anthemis, Ejara aims to become the one-stop platform where “a suite of financial products will be accessible at their fingertips, without the need for any crypto knowledge.”\n\nEjara, the Cameroonian fintech whose app enables users to buy and store cryptocurrency in decentralized wallets, recently said it had raised $8 million via a series A investment. The fintech’s latest fundraising series was jointly led by the United Kingdom-based venture capital (VC) firm Anthemis and Dragonfly Capital.\n\nParticipating in the latest round were Mercy Corps Ventures, Coinshares Ventures, and Lateral Capital which just like Anthemis had similarly joined the fintech startup’s previous round. According to a Techcrunch report, new investors include Circle Ventures, Moonstake, Emurgo, Hashkey Group, and BPI France, while Blockworks co-founder Jason Yanowitz is one of the angel investors that participated in the round.\n\nThe fintech’s latest capital raise comes just over 12 months after Ejara said it had secured $2 million via a seed round. Meanwhile, the latest capital brings the total funds that the fintech has raised in under 18 months to $10 million. Commenting on the company’s latest capital raise, Nelly Chatue-Diop, the CEO at Ejara, is quoted as saying:\n\nWhen everyone was taking the other route and building centralized exchanges, we always thought that, if you want to own crypto, you need to own your keys. And that’s pretty much what’s saved us in turbulent times.\n\nFrom the around 8,000 clients it had in October 2021, Ejara now reportedly boasts over 70,000 users that hail from nine different French-speaking African countries.\n\nMeanwhile, Ruth Foxe Blader, partner at Anthemis, noted that Ejara had no intentions of “limiting itself to being a crypto app.” Instead, the fintech is seeking to become a one-stop platform where “a suite of financial products will be accessible at users’ fingertips, without the need for any crypto knowledge.”",2022-11-30T17:00:11.000Z

Many people want him to go ahead with a phone launch even if Apple and Google do not deplatform Twitter.\n\nElon Musk revealed Friday the possibility of him launching his own smartphone, which would compete with iPhone and Android, should Apple and Google deplatform his newly acquired social media company.\n\nTwitter user Liz Wheeler suggested that Musk should produce his own smartphone if Apple and Google boot Twitter from their app stores, adding that “Half the country would happily ditch the biased, snooping iPhone & Android.” Musk replied: “I certainly hope it does not come to that, but, yes, if there is no other choice, I will make an alternative phone.”\n\nMusk’s plans for Twitter as a free speech platform could put the social media company in conflict with Apple and Google and the two tech giants could remove Twitter from their app stores.\n\nThe Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and even smaller app stores like the Amazon Appstore, have rules intended to protect users from discrimination, bullying, harassment, and any content they deem objectionable. They have delisted apps over inadequate content moderation practices as well as harmful content. Apple said in a letter to Congress last year that it had removed over 30,000 apps from its store over objectionable content in 2020.\n\nIn January last year, Apple and Google cut off Parler, a social media app focusing on free speech, following the U.S. Capital riot on Jan. 6. The two companies subsequently let the app back in their stores with some content excluded after substantial changes to the app’s content moderation practices.\n\nMany people welcome the idea of Musk producing an alternative phone. “I’d buy this. Do it even if the app stays,” one Twitter user exclaimed. Another said: “Do it anyways. There’s a huge market for an alternative to Google and Apple.” A third user stressed:\n\nIf Apple attempted the kind of strike against Twitter that it successfully launched against Parler, I can assure you Elon Musk that millions of us would unhesitatingly ditch our Apple iPhones and switch to your alternative model.\n\nSome people warned about the reality of Musk launching an alternative phone. One opined: “Even if it’s Elon Musk there are dominant 1st movers already in the space.” Another warned: “Even if he wanted to do this, it would be years before a single phone went on sale. Phones rely on components from dozens of vendors. Just to get fab space for a processor would take years, TSMC is booked for years and Samsung is far behind their node processes.”\n\nA third user shared: “Prediction: A Twitter mobile phone connected to Starlink: Always on, always connected, anywhere in the world. Capable of encrypted commutations & payments all operated under Space Law. Imagine blockchain + comms hosted on microservers in space, beyond reach of terrestrial governments.”\n\nIn addition, the Tesla CEO also complained about the 15% to 30% cut Apple and Google take from purchases made inside apps, which could eat into the revenue from Musk’s plans for $8 per month from Twitter verification subscriptions. On Nov. 18, Musk tweeted:\n\nApp store fees are obviously too high due to the iOS/Android duopoly. It is a hidden 30% tax on the Internet.\n\nMusk recently revealed plans to build X, the everything app. He said buying Twitter accelerates the creation of X by three to five years.",2022-11-27T17:00:06.000Z

Noting that the metaverse market could be as large as $13 trillion by 2030, the global financial services firm said: “The metaverse is no longer science fiction. Early metaverse platforms are already being used by millions.”\n\nA new report by Deloitte, titled “The Metaverse in Asia: Strategies for Accelerating Economic Impact,” estimates that the metaverse is a trillion-dollar opportunity in Asia. The study takes an in-depth look at 12 selected Asian economies: Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, mainland China, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.\n\nDeloitte’s report states:\n\nWe estimate that the impact of the metaverse to GDP in Asia could be between US$0.8 trillion – US$1.4 trillion per year by 2035, roughly 1.3-2.4% of overall GDP per year by 2035.\n\n“The metaverse presents a trillion-dollar opportunity to significantly transform major economies in the region … Vice versa, the Asian economies will make a meaningful impact on how the metaverse takes shape globally,” Deloitte described, noting that “the development path of this nascent technology still remains uncertain.”\n\nThe financial services firm explained: “The metaverse is no longer science fiction. Early metaverse platforms are already being used by millions … In Asia, many consumers are already gaming, socializing, attending concerts, and purchasing items on virtual platforms such as Roblox, Decentraland, Fortnite, and Asia’s very own Sandbox and Zepeto.”\n\nThe Deloitte report further details:\n\nThe potential GDP impact estimates of the metaverse globally range from US$1.5 trillion per year by 2030 and US$3 trillion per year by 2031.\n\nDuleesha Kulasooriya, Deloitte Center for the Edge’s managing director in Southeast Asia, was quoted by CNBC as saying: “If you look at the youths … they’re the ones who are interacting and engaging in the metaverse mostly today, and 60% of the world’s youths live in Asia.”\n\nThe managing director added: “The metaverse is inevitable. Developing the technology stacks, human capital, and regulatory frameworks to realize Asia’s trillion-dollar metaverse potential will benefit a wide range of industries and economic activities.”\n\nEmphasizing that “the potential growth and contribution of the metaverse could be significant globally,” the report continues:\n\nThe potential global market size estimates of the metaverse (i.e., revenue) range from US$678.8 billion … up to US$13 trillion … per year by 2030.\n\nThe $678.8 billion came from Grand View Research while the $13 trillion estimate came from Citi Group.

However, the role also includes two requirements that hint at an approach of the company to the metaverse.\n\nThese requirements include having “deep knowledge and understanding of Web3, including blockchain technologies and NFT, and/or metaverse,” and being “deeply connected to a network of investors and entrepreneurs” in these industries.\n\nThis job opening has fans fearing that Nintendo might be planning to release a series of NFTs or to prepare a metaverse based on the franchise. Twitter user Rogue reacted negatively, rejecting the possible development, posting:\n\nI think a lot of people boutta drop interest in pokemon. This, to me, as a 10-year player, scares me.\n\nAlthough other companies like Niantic have already developed virtual reality-enhanced Pokemon games like Pokemon Go, Nintendo has been apprehensive when it comes to dealing with NFTs and the metaverse. In February 2022, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa stated that while the metaverse had great potential, the company would have to be able to offer new and fresh experiences to experiment with it. Furukawa explained:\n\nWe might consider something if we can find a way to convey a ‘Nintendo approach’ to the metaverse that many people can readily understand.\n\nThis differentiates Nintendo from other game developers that have already included NFTs, Web3, and metaverse experiences as part of their business plans, like Square Enix, Bandai Namco, and even Sega.",2023-03-15T17:15:00.000Z

The agency, Rosfinmonitoring, is following thousands of participants in digital asset transactions with a new blockchain analytics system, the official revealed.\n\nThe turnover of crypto assets in Russia is growing, according to Yury Chikhanchin, director of the Federal Financial Monitoring Service of the Russian Federation, who reported to President Vladimir Putin about the agency’s current operations.\n\nThe watchdog is monitoring the activities of over 25,000 participants in crypto transactions, the executive revealed at a meeting with the head of state. The service has also identified around a dozen financial organizations that provide assistance to them.\n\nQuoted by the business news portal RBC, Putin remarked that wherever money or new financial instruments appear, “swindlers” appear as well. Chikhanchin admitted that the use of cryptocurrency is increasing in Russia in the absence of comprehensive regulation.\n\n“We believe that the cryptocurrency turnover today is more than 630,000 bitcoins,” he detailed without elaborating. At current rates, that amount of BTC nears $13 billion in fiat equivalent. According to an estimate quoted by the Bank of Russia in 2021, the annual volume of crypto transactions made by Russians at the time was around $5 billion.\n\nRosfinmonitoring has carried out about 120 crypto-related investigations and initiated over 60 criminal cases. Chikhanchin pointed out that this was possible thanks to the launch of Russia’s new ‘Transparent Blockchain’ platform.\n\n“A year ago, the service could only track bitcoin, but using this system allows you to see the movements of more than 20 different crypto assets,” the official explained.

Democratic senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal directed a letter to the company to halt these actions, citing concerns about the interactions that teens could have in Meta’s virtual worlds.\n\nTwo Democratic senators have written a letter asking Meta to stop its recently reported plan of opening its metaverse world to teens. Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal, Democrat senators from Massachusetts and Connecticut, criticize the idea of opening Horizon Worlds, Meta’s flagship metaverse app, to teens 13 years and up, citing diverse factors that might endanger them through the interactions available in this virtual world.\n\nThe letter differentiates between standard virtual reality experiences and Horizon Worlds, explaining that “the cumulative set of immersive virtual reality experiences a teenager would confront on the socially-driven Horizon Worlds are distinct from their use of a virtual reality headset to, for example, play a specific single-player game. Inviting young teens into this environment, therefore, poses serious risks.”\n\nMarkey and Blumenthal call for halting the plan to protect the health of these young users and their privacy in the metaverse, calling out the company for its previous mistakes involving this demographic.\n\n➖The Wall Street Journal reported on Meta’s plan of including teens in its metaverse on Feb. 7. According to an internal memo obtained by the news outlet, the company’s new strategy included opening the Horizon Worlds experience to teens aged 13 years old and up. This would constitute a change from the current policies of the app, which only allows users from 18 years old to roam the virtual world.\n\nAccording to WSJ, Meta’s memo reinforces the need of pushing these services to young users in order to keep growing. Horizon Worlds VP Gabriel Aul reportedly stated:\n\n🔝Today our competitors are doing a much better job meeting the unique needs of these cohorts. For Horizon to succeed we need to ensure that we serve this cohort first and foremost.\n\nWhile Horizon Worlds experienced rapid growth in its initial stages, growing its user base tenfold soon after release in Decemeber 2021, the app has been criticized for its buggy state even by Meta’s own employees. In October, VP of Metaverse Vishal Shah acknowledged that the issues present in the app hampered the experience for its users and that even employees of the company were not spending much time using it.",2023-03-06T17:00:12.000Z

The objective of the company is to expand its engineering staff to accelerate the production of its blockchain-focused silicon and collaborate in the development of its cryptographic-focused chips.\n\nChain Reaction, a startup that focuses on building blockchain-based silicon, announced that it has raised $70 million as part of its Series C funding round. The round, which was led by Morgan Creek Digital, part of Morgan Creek Capital — a VC company co-founded by crypto influencer Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano — saw the participation of Hanaco Ventures, Jerusalem Venture Partners, KCK Capital, Exor, Atreides Management, and Blue Run Ventures.\n\n🌊With this capital influx, the company expects to increase its engineering headcount in order to hasten the development of its blockchain silicon products, estimated to reach the market later this year. According to Alon Webman, co-founder and CEO of Chain Reaction, the mass production of the first batch of chips, called “Electrum,” will start in Q1 2023.\n\nAccording to reports from Reuters, Electrum will be a highly efficient ASIC chip designed for bitcoin mining, a field dominated by companies like Bitmain. The fabless startup enrolled the services of TSMC, one of the biggest foundries in Taiwan, to mass produce the chips.\n\nWhile the company did not disclose its valuation, Techcrunch estimates it to be around $500 million, having raised $115 million since its founding.\n\nChain Reaction aims to use its first batch of blockchain chips as a trampoline to developing more advanced silicon, designed to tackle cryptographic problems.\n\nThe more advanced chips would be centered around a technique called homomorphic encryption, which allegedly could allow them to make operations with encrypted data without decrypting it in the first place.\n\nThis could have several applications in the cryptography field, allowing for more efficient and private operations without having to put plain information in the open when working with data.\n\nThe company is optimistic about having a solution for this cryptographic issue, even with today’s limited processing capabilities. Chain Reaction co-founder and CEO Alon Webman stated:\n\n🗣We think our solution will make homomorphic encryption viable. We have unique architecture and we also understand the limitations on compute and memory among processors today. We have the solution needed to make it possible.\n\nChain Reaction expects to launch this chip sometime at the end of 2024.",2023-02-25T19:00:03.000Z

Shinichi Uchida, executive director of the Bank of Japan, explained that the goals of this new pilot are to test the technical feasibility of the currency and to include private businesses in its design process.\n\nThe Bank of Japan is advancing in its research for the issuance of a hypothetical Japanese central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yen. On Feb. 17, Shinichi Uchida, executive director of the Bank of Japan, announced the bank had decided to launch a new pilot for the digital yen, as a continuation of two phases of proof-of-concept tests.\n\nUchida said that the new pilot will focus its activities in two directions. The first one will be the fine-tuning of the technical aspects of the currency, in order to test new use cases and integrate the system with other structures.\n\nHe declared:\n\nWe plan to develop a system for experiments, where a central system, intermediary network systems, intermediary systems, and endpoint devices would be configured in an integrated manner.\n\nThe second direction has to do with the inclusion of private institutions in the pilot to provide feedback and help improve the design of the digital yen. To achieve this goal, the Bank of Japan will establish a CBDC Forum, with private entities in the payments area being invited to contribute to the project.\n\nUchida also explained the way in which the announced pilot tests will be executed. The Bank of Japan will take an incremental approach, proposing narrower objectives first and then expanding the scope of the program. Also, he clarified the new pilot will not include transactions between retailers and consumers, with only simulated transactions being settled during this test.\n\nThe launch of this test is no surprise, as Nikkei had reported about it in November. At that time, the outlet informed the tests would have a duration of two years, and would focus on testing the functionality of the system in offline environments.\n\nEven with the launch of this pilot program, the issuance of a digital yen is still not a sure thing.

Call it 3% to 4%,” the economist suggested.\n\nEconomist Mohamed El-Erian warned on Friday that the Federal Reserve cannot achieve its inflation target of 2% without “crushing the economy.” El-Erian is president of Queens’ College, Cambridge University, and chair of Gramercy Funds Management. He is also chief economic adviser at Allianz, the corporate parent of PIMCO, one of the largest investment managers.\n\n“You need a higher stable inflation rate. Call it 3% to 4%,” the economist stressed in an interview with Bloomberg Television. He emphasized:\n\nI don’t think they can get CPI to 2% without crushing the economy, but that’s because 2% is not the right target.\n\nEl-Erian’s comments followed the government’s consumer price index (CPI) data released Tuesday. On a month-by-month basis, prices increased by 0.5% in January, the most since October. On an annual basis, consumer prices climbed 6.4% in January, down from 6.5% in December. Following the CPI report, several Fed officials said the U.S. central bank may have to raise interest rates beyond initial expectations in order to subdue the ongoing price pressures.\n\nThe Allianz economic advisor explained that there are several factors that necessitate a higher target inflation rate. They include supply-side developments, including an energy transition, the change in supply chains during the pandemic, a tight labor market, and shifting geopolitical issues.\n\nEl-Erian said the Federal Reserve is “too data dependent.” Noting that “It’s right to take data into account but you’ve got to have a view of where you’re going,” he cautioned that the problem now is that the Fed is stuck chasing an elusive 2% goal. In January, El-Erian predicted that inflation may become “sticky” around the 4% range.\n\nThe economist previously warned that the Federal Reserve could lose credibility if it changes the inflation Target.

Gensler emphasized:\n\nToday’s proposal, in covering all asset classes, would cover all crypto assets.\n\nThe SEC chairman proceeded to highlight four key proposed changes to the existing regulations. Firstly, the proposal will help ensure that customer assets “are properly segregated,” he said. Secondly, for the first time, advisers and qualified custodians will be required to “enter into written agreements with each other that help guarantee the custodian’s protections,” Gensler explained, adding that they include requiring custodians to undergo annual evaluations from public accountants, provide account statements, and provide records upon request.\n\nThe proposal would also “make explicit that the custody rule’s safeguards apply to discretionary trading — when an adviser would seek to buy or sell an investor’s assets on behalf of an investor,” Gensler described. Further, it would “enhance requirements for foreign financial institutions that serve either as qualified custodians or as sub-custodians to a qualified custodian,” he detailed.\n\n“Though some crypto trading and lending platforms may claim to custody investors’ crypto, that does not mean they are qualified custodians,” the SEC chairman stressed, elaborating:\n\nBased upon how crypto platforms generally operate, investment advisers cannot rely on them as qualified custodians.\n\nCurrent regulations already cover “a significant amount of crypto assets,” Gensler pointed out, noting that most crypto assets “are likely to be funds or crypto asset securities covered by the current rule.”\n\nReiterating his concerns that crypto platforms are not properly segregating customer assets, the SEC chairman said:\n\nRather than properly segregating investors’ crypto, these platforms have commingled those assets with their own crypto or other investors’ crypto.\n\n“When these platforms go bankrupt — something we’ve seen time and again recently — investors’ assets often have become property of the failed company, leaving investors in line at the bankruptcy court,” Gensler warned. Last year, a number of crypto firms filed for bankruptcy, including FTX, Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), and Blockfi.\n\nThe SEC has recently been active in the crypto space. Last week, the securities watchdog charged cryptocurrency exchange Kraken over its staking program. The commission has also sent a Wells notice to Paxos regarding stablecoin Binance USD (BUSD), alleging that the crypto is a security and that Paxos should have registered the offering under federal securities laws.

We look forward to sharing additional information in the future.\n\nMicrosoft had previously announced a round of 10,000 layoffs as part of a restructuring process in January.\n\nThe recent turn of events suggests that Microsoft is taking part of its resources from metaverse initiatives to put into other areas like artificial intelligence (AI).

The artist argued that NFTs should be covered under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment but the jury disagreed.\n\nFrench luxury design house Hermes has won a lawsuit against Mason Rothschild, the artist behind the “Metabirkins” non-fungible token (NFT) collection which features digital depictions of Hermes’ popular Birkin bags.\n\nRothschild created the Metabirkins NFT collection in 2021, which he described as “a collection of 100 unique NFTs created with faux fur in a range of contemporary color and graphic executions.” The collection has fetched more than 200 ETH in sales, equivalent to $331,684 at the time of writing. Hermes complained and sued the artist early last year for trademark infringement.\n\nRothschild argued that NFTs should be covered under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment. The artist’s defense team compared his work to that of Andy Warhol who depicted Campbell’s soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles in his artwork. Rothschild argued in court:\n\nThese images, and the NFTs that authenticate them, are not handbags. They carry nothing but meaning.\n\nHermes’ lawyers have accused Rothschild of “stealing the goodwill in Hermes’ famous intellectual property to create and sell his own line of products.” They argued that customers are likely to confuse Metabirkins NFTs with genuine Hermes products. They further said the Metabirkins URL is too similar to the one used by the luxury brand. Oren Warshavsky, a lawyer representing Hermes said in court: “The reason for these sales was the Birkin name.”\n\nAfter deliberating for two days, a New York jury delivered a verdict on Wednesday stating that they “found the defendant liable for trademark infringement” and “trademark dilution.” In addition, they found that “the First Amendment protection does not bar liability.” The jury then awarded Hermes $133,000 in damages — $110,000 for trademark infringement and $23,000 for cybersquatting.",2023-02-10T17:00:11.000Z

According to the FSC’s Lee Su-young, security token investors are expected to get the same protection that is provided to investors in conventional securities.\n\nThe South Korean financial markets regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), has okayed the issuance and distribution of security tokens, a report has said. According to the report, Korean investors are expected to begin trading security tokens once the regulator has concluded revising the relevant laws.\n\nAs per a report in The Korea Times, regulators are hoping that the changes will not only enable investors to make fractional investments, but will also ensure security token holders get the same protection that is accorded to conventional securities investors.\n\n“We have decided to allow the new form of digitized securities to be issued here. This will enable investors to make fractional investments with more ease via the security token. We will also protect security token investors on par with those investing in conventional securities,” Lee Su-young, an official from the regulator’s capital market division, reportedly said.\n\nAlso, according to the report, the FSC’s decision to amend the relevant sections of the relevant laws is because it wants the Korean electronic securities and capital markets to reflect “the global investment paradigm shift.”\n\nMeanwhile, Kim Se-hee, an analyst with Eugene Investment & Securities, is quoted in the same report highlighting the likely benefits of expanding the list of tradable assets. Some of the Korean brokerage firms that are reportedly updating their respective trading apps to enable security token trading include KB Securities, Shinhan Securities, and Kiwoom Securities.\n\nWhile the FSC has taken steps that now make it possible for investors to acquire and hold fractionalized securities, an unnamed source quoted in the report tells investors to think before buying a security token. However, despite this and other concerns, the unnamed source nonetheless insisted that it is “a good sign that the FSC is showing signs of easing regulations on some trendy investment areas.”",2023-02-07T17:00:10.000Z

Gopax fell into trouble following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and the bankruptcy filing of crypto lender Genesis Global.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Binance announced Friday that it has invested in Gopax, a licensed crypto exchange in South Korea. The investment marks Binance’s return to the Korean crypto market, which the company exited two years ago, citing low usage and trading volume.\n\nGopax halted withdrawals of both principal and interest payments from its decentralized finance (defi) service “Gofi” in November last year “as a consequence of the upstream challenges experienced by Genesis Global Capital LLC,” Binance detailed. “Since then, Gopax has been working closely with local regulators and industry partners in an effort to raise funds to make affected users whole.” The global crypto exchange explained:\n\nAs part of this transaction, Binance will inject capital into Gopax with the objective of securing in full any potential Gofi users’ withdrawal requests against all staked deposits, including interest.\n\nGofi’s products are provided by its partner, Genesis Global Capital, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), Gopax previously explained. Genesis halted redemptions and new loan originations at its lending arm General Global Trading in November following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.\n\nThe crypto lender then filed for bankruptcy in January following a lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleging that the company offered and sold unregistered securities to retail investors. Gopax’s parent company Streami Inc. is listed as one of Genesis Global’s 10 largest known creditors in the bankruptcy filing.\n\nAccording to Binance’s chief business officer, Yibo Ling, the company has taken a “meaningful” equity stake in Gopax but the terms of the deal have not been disclosed.\n\nBinance’s stake in Gopax is part of its Industry Recovery Initiative (IRI), launched in November last year following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and the bankruptcy filings of several crypto firms.\n\nNoting that the initiative was created “to support promising companies that were negatively impacted by the events of last year,” Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) emphasized:\n\nWe hope that taking this step with Gopax will further rebuild the Korean crypto and blockchain industry.\n\nThe two crypto exchanges will also work closely “to improve user education and blockchain awareness through Binance Academy,” Friday’s announcement adds, concluding that Binance is committed to collaborating with local regulators and stakeholders to explore how it can “leverage its technology and liquidity to support the local ecosystem.”\n\nThe South Korean government announced this week that it will adopt a cryptocurrency tracking system within the first half of this year.

In addition, billionaire Elon Musk’s electric car company recorded $204 million of impairment losses resulting from changes in the prices of bitcoin.\n\nElon Musk’s electric car company, Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), filed its annual report for the year ended Dec. 31, 2022, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday.\n\nThe filing shows that the fair market value of Tesla’s BTC holdings was $191 million at the end of 2022 while their carrying value was $184 million, as Bitcoin News previously reported. “As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the carrying value of our digital assets held was $184 million and $1.26 billion, which reflects cumulative impairments of $204 million and $101 million, each period, respectively,” the company detailed, elaborating:\n\nThe fair market value of such digital assets held as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $191 million and $1.99 billion, respectively.\n\nThe filing also notes that during the two years ended Dec. 31, 2022, Tesla “purchased and/or received an immaterial amount and $1.50 billion, respectively, of digital assets.”\n\nThe electric car company invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin in Q1 2021 but sold 75% of its holdings in Q2 2022. The company also accepts the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE) for some merchandise, which accounted for an “immaterial amount” of digital assets as stated in the SEC filing.\n\nThe electric car company explained that digital assets are considered “indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules.” Therefore, “any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges,” Tesla described, adding:\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $204 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of $64 million on certain conversions of bitcoin into fiat currency by us.\n\nSince its BTC acquisition, Tesla only sold its bitcoin once, which was in the second quarter of 2022. The company sold 75% of its bitcoin holdings which added $936 million in cash to its balance sheet. CEO Elon Musk explained at the time that the company is “certainly open to increasing our bitcoin holdings in [the] future,” noting that the sale was due to concerns about the company’s overall liquidity, “given Covid shutdowns in China.”\n\nTesla’s SEC filing also states:\n\nWe may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions.",2023-02-01T17:00:06.000Z

It also notes that legislation should not greenlight mainstream institutions “to dive headlong into cryptocurrency markets.”\n\nThe White House published a blog post titled “The Administration’s Roadmap to Mitigate Cryptocurrencies’ Risks” Friday under the National Economic Council (NEC), an Executive Office of the President (EOP) established to advise the president on U.S. and global economic policy.\n\nThe roadmap is authored by four White House advisors: NEC Director Brian Deese, Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Director Arati Prabhakar, Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) Chair Cecilia Rouse, and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. The CEA is charged with providing objective economic advice on the formulation of both domestic and international economic policy while the OSTP advises the president on all matters related to science and technology.\n\nThe White House advisors detailed:\n\nAt President Biden’s direction, we have spent the past year identifying the risks of cryptocurrencies and acting to mitigate them using the authorities that the Executive Branch has.\n\n“Experts across the administration have laid out the first-ever framework for developing digital assets in a safe, responsible way while addressing the risks they pose,” they added.\n\nThe framework identifies a number of risks, including crypto entities ignoring applicable financial regulations and basic risk controls, misleading consumers, having conflicts of interest, providing inadequate disclosures, and committing outright fraud. Moreover, the authors claimed that “there is poor cybersecurity across the industry” that has enabled North Korea to “steal over a billion dollars to fund its aggressive missile program.”\n\nWhile encouraging regulators to continue “using their authorities to ramp up enforcement where appropriate and issue new guidance where needed,” the roadmap authors stressed:\n\nThe events of the past year underscore that more is needed. Agencies have redoubled their efforts to fight fraud … Enforcement agencies are devoting increased resources to combatting illicit activities involving digital assets.\n\n“In the coming months, the Administration will also unveil priorities for digital assets research and development, which will help the technologies powering cryptocurrencies protect consumers by default,” they revealed.\n\nThe roadmap also calls on Congress to “step up its efforts” in regulating the crypto sector, such as expanding regulators’ powers to prevent misuse of customer assets and mitigate conflicts of interest.\n\nThe White House advisors suggested that Congress could also strengthen transparency and disclosure requirements for cryptocurrency firms, increase penalties for violating illicit-finance rules, and subject crypto intermediaries to bans against tipping off criminals. However, they cautioned:\n\nLegislation should not greenlight mainstream institutions, like pension funds, to dive headlong into cryptocurrency markets.\n\nThe advisors explained that the limited exposure of traditional financial institutions to crypto over the past year has prevented turmoil in the crypto market from affecting the broader financial system.\n\nIn conclusion, they emphasized:\n\nThe Administration wholeheartedly supports responsible technological innovations that make financial services cheaper, faster, safer, and more accessible.\n\nNonetheless, the roadmap authors noted that “to realize these benefits, new technologies need commensurate safeguards,” elaborating: “To put the right safeguards in place, we will keep driving forward the digital-assets framework we’ve developed, while working with Congress to achieve these goals.”",2023-01-29T17:00:05.000Z

The tech giant’s recent conference call was considered disappointing, and earnings from firms such as Boeing, Texas Instruments, and 3M were also lackluster. Gold and silver prices were down between 0.43% and 0.72% on Wednesday, and the cryptocurrency economy dropped 2.79% against the U.S. dollar in the past 24 hours.\n\nAfter a couple of bullish weeks, stocks, precious metals, and cryptocurrencies were down on Jan. 25, 2023. As investors awaited the next U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, the state of the U.S. economy showed a great deal of weakness. Earnings reports from Microsoft, Union Pacific, Texas Instruments, and others on Wednesday indicated that the economy was not improving and added to lingering concerns about a potential U.S. recession.\n\nOn Wednesday morning into the afternoon, the four benchmark stock indexes the U.S. — the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), the S&P 500 (SPX), the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC), and the Russell 2000 (RUT) — were all down between 1% and 2.05%. In addition to lackluster earnings reports from some of the country’s largest firms, industrial production in the U.S. slipped roughly 0.7% in December 2022.\n\nIndustrial production also dropped in November 2022, falling 0.6% year-over-year. Another shocker was the fact that retail sales during the holiday season were also low in November and December 2022. Data indicates that retail sales slipped 1.1% last month and, while the holidays were in full effect, it was the largest drop of the year.\n\nPrecious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum all saw losses against the U.S. dollar in the last 24 hours as well. The New York spot price on Jan. 25, 2023, indicates that gold is trading for $1,931.70 per troy ounce, down 0.43%. An ounce of silver is down 0.72% and trading for $23.59 per unit on Wednesday at 11 a.m. Eastern Time. Kenneth Broux, a strategist at Société Générale, says that escalating tensions in Ukraine, low corporate earnings, and recession fears are plaguing investors.\n\n“The market is definitely worried about slowing earnings growth, especially in tech, so there has been a sense the market wants to keep selling tech and the dollar,” Broux remarked on Wednesday. “But a huge tail risk now is what happens in Ukraine, if there is an escalation in the conflict and Europe gets drawn into the conflict,” the strategist added.\n\nThe cryptocurrency economy is hovering just above the $1 trillion mark at $1,019,712,653,474, according to Wednesday’s recorded metrics. Crypto markets are down 2.79% as a whole, and bitcoin (BTC) has shed 1.49% on Wednesday. The second-leading cryptocurrency, ethereum (ETH), has lost even more, with 4.66% erased from its value since Tuesday.\n\nGlobal cryptocurrency trade volumes were above the $100 billion region per day not too long ago, but today, global trade volume is around $55.98 billion across the entire cryptocurrency economy. Despite the pullback on Wednesday, precious metals, equities, and cryptocurrency assets are still doing much better than they were last month. By 11:30 a.m. (ET) on Wednesday, gold increased against the U.S. dollar but is still down 0.2% and silver rose as well and is currently up 0.13%.",2023-01-26T17:00:05.000Z

SWIFT is the most widely used global system for interbank transfers.\n\nOnly 0.01% of Binance’s monthly users are serviced by Signature Bank and no other banking partners are impacted, the crypto company pointed out through a spokesperson. Card payments and non-USD transfers will not be affected.\n\nThe news comes after in December the New York-based Signature Bank revealed it plans to shed up to $10 billion in deposits from digital-asset clients as it’s pull back from the crypto industry. The move was announced in the aftermath of the collapse of FTX, one of Binance’s main competitors which filed for bankruptcy protection in November amid liquidity issues.\n\nTraditional financial companies have been gripped by contagion fears during a turbulent year for the crypto space, with falling prices and a number of crashes. Silvergate Capital, the parent company of California-based Silvergate Bank which deals with crypto transactions, saw its shares losing 40% after customers withdrew over $8 billion of digital-asset deposits in Q4, 2022.\n\nSignature’s shares fell 64% last year, the report notes.

He also serves as chairman of Roubini Global Economics, a global macroeconomic and market strategy research firm that he co-founded. He told the news outlet:\n\nLiterally, 99.99% of crypto is a scam, a criminal activity, a total real-bubble Ponzi scheme that is going bust.\n\nDr. Doom also shared his opinion on the collapsed crypto exchange FTX and its disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). FTX filed for bankruptcy last November and SBF is currently facing several fraud charges, all of which he has pleaded not guilty to. “FTX and SBF are not an exception — they’re a rule,” Roubini exclaimed.\n\nThe NYU professor proceeded to advise against investing in cryptocurrencies. He stated that 99% of bitcoin investors did not buy BTC at $1,000 or $10,000. “Most of them got FOMO [fear of missing out] in 2021 when it was skyrocketing from $20,000 to … $69,000,” he stressed, emphasizing that 99% of bitcoin investors bought the cryptocurrency “well above the current market value.”\n\nRoubini opined, “So they lost their shirts. It’s a nightmare.” Dr. Doom noted that bitcoin investors are not alone in losing money as other cryptocurrencies “have fallen by 90%, 95%.” He added: “Out of 20,000 ICOs [initial coin offerings], officially 80% were a scam and another 17% have gone to zero. So that means 97% of them … were either a scam or lost everything.”\n\nRegarding crypto investing, Roubini advised:\n\nYou have to stay away. You have to absolutely stay away. And most of these people belong literally in jail — literally, they’re all crooks.\n\nThe NYU professor of economics has long been a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies, claiming that most crypto proponents are conmen. He called Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) “a walking time bomb.”\n\nRecently, the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, warned that most crypto tokens will fail, urging investors not to FOMO into this asset class.

For the organization, the biggest impact of the implementation of this tech will be observed in industrial environments, where it will contribute to carrying out more tasks and reducing expenses.\n\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) believes that the metaverse will be first applied in industrial environments, instead of being adopted first by consumers. In an article published on Jan. 13, the organization predicts that the implementation of the metaverse will be done at an industrial level first, helping different companies to complete designing and monitoring tasks in a more efficient way.\n\nTwo of the metaverse technologies that will become integral for the industry in this new phase are digital twins and extended reality. Implementing digital twins, the digitalization of a group of elements coming from the real world, will allow testing the functionality of an element, or examining the possible inefficiencies of an assembly line, or simply prototyping a model without having to build it physically.\n\nExtended reality, another of the technologies mentioned in the article, will allow designers to mix elements from the real world with digital elements, to examine the interactions between both.\n\nThese technologies are already being adopted by several companies, including automaker Renault, which launched its industrial metaverse in November, aiming to save $330 million by 2025 with the implementation.\n\nWhile there is significant focus on the consumer metaverse from companies like Meta, which have been investing billions in the sector, the WEF believes that industries will be the ones pushing innovation.\n\nThe article states:\n\nWe will develop many technologies for the industrial metaverse that will make their way into the consumer metaverse – from micro-optics and advanced haptic interfaces to AI sensing awareness.\n\nThe organization believes that, once these two different metaverses are established, one will be able to improve the other and vice versa. However, it recommends shifting the focus from putting resources into the consumer metaverse, to putting them into the industrial metaverse, which is already happening in various sectors.\n\nThe WEF has referred to the metaverse before, issuing recommendations for maintaining safety and privacy in metaverse worlds in May 2022, especially when including children as part of these environments.",2023-01-17T17:00:16.000Z

It seeks “to provide economic exposure to the value of bitcoin,” Samsung detailed.\n\nSamsung Asset Management (Hong Kong) Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Samsung Asset Management, a member of the Samsung Group of companies, launched a bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Friday called “Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF.”\n\nThe new ETF is a sub-fund of Samsung ETFs Trust III, an umbrella unit trust established under Hong Kong law, the company detailed, adding:\n\nThe investment objective of the sub-fund is to seek to provide economic exposure to the value of bitcoin by investing predominately in front-month bitcoin futures contracts and/or micro bitcoin futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nSamsung explained that the actively managed bitcoin futures ETF paves the way “for investment in future crypto-technology adoption.” However, the company noted that the fund “does not invest directly in bitcoin and will not receive any bitcoin from bitcoin futures on CME.” CME is regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nWhile bitcoin is priced in U.S. dollars, units of the Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF are listed and traded in Hong Kong dollars on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK), the company clarified.\n\nThe bitcoin futures ETF is managed by Samsung Asset Management (Hong Kong) Ltd. while HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Asia) Ltd. is the fund’s trustee and registrar. The fund “will enter into and have exposure of up to 100%” of its net asset value (NAV) in Bitcoin Futures on CME, the company added.\n\nThe newly launched ETF is not Samsung Asset Management’s only crypto-related fund. In June last year, the Hong Kong firm launched “Samsung Blockchain Technologies ETF” and “Samsung Asia Pacific ex NZ Metaverse Theme ETF.”",2023-01-14T17:00:09.000Z

He was arrested Wednesday at John F. Kennedy International Airport.\n\nThe Mutant Ape Planet (MAP) NFTs were marketed and sold with false promises of numerous rewards and benefits, including exclusive opportunities for additional investments, giveaways, merchandise, and other rewards, the DOJ detailed, elaborating:\n\nAfter selling out of the NFTs, the purchasers were ‘rug pulled’ … Millions worth of the NFT purchasers’ cryptocurrency was diverted for Michel’s personal benefit.\n\nMutant Ape Planet is a collection of 6,799 unique mutant apes that has no relationship with the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club, a different set of monkey-themed NFTs.\n\nIvan J.

The former FTX executive has been charged with “defrauding customers of FTX.com, investors in FTX.com, and lenders to Alameda Research,” the Justice Department noted.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) reached out to victims of Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)’s fraud via its website Friday, explaining their rights and asking them to come forward. Bankman-Fried co-founded FTX and served as its CEO when the crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy in November last year.\n\nThe DOJ wrote:\n\nIf you believe that you may have been a victim of fraud by Samuel Bankman-Fried, a/k/a ‘SBF,’ please contact the victim/witness coordinator at the United States Attorney’s Office … for assistance in verifying whether you are a victim in this case.\n\nThe Justice Department explained that on Dec. 13, 2022, “an eight-count indictment was unsealed charging Samuel Bankman-Fried with defrauding customers of FTX.com, investors in FTX.com, and lenders to Alameda Research.”\n\nThe DOJ detailed: “Bankman-Fried is charged with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to defraud the United States and violate the campaign finance laws.”\n\nProsecutors are required by federal law to contact possible crime victims to inform them of their rights.\n\nHowever, in court papers filed on Friday, federal prosecutors in Manhattan asked U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who has been assigned to the SBF case, for permission to use a website to notify victims, rather than contacting each individually. They claimed that the collapsed crypto exchange FTX could owe money to more than one million people, making it “impracticable” to contact each person.\n\nBankman-Fried, who is currently at his parents’ house on a $250 billion bond, has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges. Meanwhile, the DOJ has moved to seize shares of Robinhood Markets (Nasdaq: HOOD), worth about $460 million, linked to the former FTX boss.",2023-01-08T17:00:10.000Z

The decision establishes a precedent that might affect the status of other, similar cases involving crypto companies like Blockfi and FTX.\n\nA U.S. bankruptcy court has made a key ruling in the conflict that Celsius, a former cryptocurrency lending firm, and its customers, maintain over the ownership of deposits. Judge Martin Glenn, of a New York-based bankruptcy court, ruled in favor of the company, stating that it has the right over these funds, allowing it to harness the assets in any way, including lending, selling, and pledging these assets for investment purposes.\n\nThe company had filed a motion to get approval for selling $23 million from its stablecoin stash on Sept. 15, and this ruling frees the path for the company to complete this operation. The decision states that Celsius’ terms of service, an agreement that all users must approve before being serviced by the company, was “unambiguous” in establishing the ownership of these funds deposited in favor of the firm.\n\nThe ruling might affect other cases involving companies that have invoked Chapter 11 bankruptcy benefits, like Blockfi and FTX. 600,000 customers of the lending company are affected by this decision, who were part of the Earn program that yielded high interest on their accounts, which contained $4.2 billion dollars in cryptocurrency. These customers will now be classified as unsecured creditors, possibly affecting the size and significance of their claims in the future.\n\nThis will allow the company to use part of the funds to finance its Chapter 11 procedures. Before, the company had stated prior to bankruptcy courts that it could only finance its operations until March with its current funding.\n\nThe Celsius bankruptcy processes have also affected the privacy of its customers, as a filing detailing the usernames, transactions, and holdings of every user of the exchange were released in October. More than 18.6 gigabytes of data corresponding to more than 14,000 customers of the exchange were disclosed at the time, with the situation being qualified as one of the most “egregious privacy violations in crypto history,” according to some users.",2023-01-05T17:00:08.000Z

On Jan. 1, data shows that $22.95 billion was traded in the last 24 hours, compared to double that amount, $54.78 billion, two weeks earlier. On November 8, 2022, 54 days prior, amid the FTX collapse, global cryptocurrency trade volumes were approximately $115.33 billion.\n\nCryptocurrency trade volumes worldwide have significantly declined since the beginning of the year. For example, on Jan. 2, 2022, one year ago, the global trade volume for the 24-hour period was approximately $70.48 billion, according to archived coingecko.com statistics. Today’s 24-hour volume worldwide is 67.43% less at $22.95 billion. In addition, 71.63% of all trades on Jan. 1, 2023, were paired with the cryptocurrency economy’s stablecoins.\n\nWhile all the stablecoins today represent $16.44 billion in trade volume, tether (USDT) commands $12.45 billion, which equates to 71.63% of the aggregate on Jan. 1, 2023. Two weeks ago on Dec. 15, the global trade volume was $54.78 billion and a good majority of those trades were in stablecoins as well. Cryptocurrency trade volumes have been declining since Jan. 2022, with monthly spikes in May, Sept., and Nov. 2022.\n\nThe November spike occurred amid the chaos surrounding FTX’s insolvency, and there were significantly higher daily trade volumes at that time. Data from The Block’s crypto exchange volume (legitimate index) shows that Oct. 2022 had $543.67 billion in volume, while Nov. 2022 saw an increase of approximately 23.79% to $673.01 billion. Now that Dec. 2022 is over, statistics show that Dec. 2022’s total volumes were around $357.48 billion, or 46.88% lower than the previous month.\n\nThe last time global cryptocurrency trade volumes were this low was two years ago in December 2020. At that time, global crypto trade volumes were 7.27% higher at $385.51 billion. Lower cryptocurrency trade volumes can have both positive and negative implications for investors.\n\nOn one hand, low trade volume is often seen as a sign of a lack of interest in the crypto market, which could potentially indicate lower values. On the other hand, low trade volume can sometimes be interpreted as a bullish sign for the cryptocurrency economy, as it may suggest limited selling pressure.",2023-01-02T17:00:14.000Z

He explained that Tesla sales have depended in part on the perception that CEO Elon Musk “is a cool guy” while the price of bitcoin is “being sustained by a hard-core group of true believers.”\n\nPaul Krugman, who won the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity, published an opinion piece in the New York Times Tuesday about Tesla, bitcoin, and their huge valuations. He wrote:\n\nTesla and bitcoin may have more in common than you think.\n\nThe economist explained that mega-corporations like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon have maintained their dominance because these companies “benefit from strong network externalities — loosely speaking, everyone uses their products because everyone else uses their products.”\n\nHowever, “It’s hard to see what would give Tesla a long-term lock on the electric vehicle business,” Krugman described. “Where are the powerful network externalities in the electric vehicle business?” he questioned, emphasizing: “Electric vehicle production just doesn’t look like a network externality business.”\n\nKrugman continued:\n\nIt’s hard to explain the huge valuation the market put on Tesla before the [price] drop, or even its current value.\n\nThe Nobel Prize laureate proceeded to explain “why Tesla was ever worth so much.” He believes that it’s because “investors fell in love with a storyline about a brilliant, cool innovator, despite the absence of a good argument about how this guy, even if he really was who he appeared to be, could found a long-lived money machine.” Krugman added: “Tesla sales have surely depended at least in part on the perception that Musk himself is a cool guy.”\n\nDescribing a parallel between Tesla and bitcoin, the Nobel Prize-winning economist detailed:\n\nDespite years of effort, nobody has yet managed to find any serious use for cryptocurrency other than money laundering. But prices nonetheless soared on the hype, and are still being sustained by a hard-core group of true believers.\n\n“Something similar surely happened with Tesla, even though the company does actually make useful things,” Krugman concluded.\n\nAt the time of writing, Tesla’s stock has fallen 70% year-to-date while bitcoin’s price has dropped 65% during the same time period.",2022-12-30T17:00:12.000Z

The FTX meltdown has exacerbated the problem, hurting “the sentiment across crypto tokens.” Local crypto experts are not expecting a recovery in the near future “Unless something dramatic happens” in the upcoming Union Budget.\n\nCryptocurrency trading volumes at major exchanges in India have plunged significantly this year. Since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, major exchanges in India lost between 34% and 50% of trading volumes, Moneycontrol reported Monday, citing data from research firm Crebaco. However, the decline began long before the FTX implosion. One of the largest crypto trading platforms in India, Wazirx, lost 97.99% of its trading volumes from the beginning of the year to Dec. 22.\n\nCrebaco CEO Sidharth Sogani told the publication:\n\nI don’t think a lot of this recent trading volume plunge was driven by FTX. The market in India has been dead since April 2022.\n\n“I don’t expect any action or recovery for the sector in India in the next six months, until something major gets announced in the Union Budget,” he continued.\n\nWazirx’s vice president of marketing, Rajagopal Menon, opined: “It all comes down to the removing / reducing the TDS (tax deducted at source) and capital gains without setoff for losses. No one is trading on Indian exchanges because of that.”\n\nIn this year’s Union Budget 2022, the Indian government imposed a 30% income tax on virtual digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and a 1% TDS on all transactions of 10,000 rupees ($121) or more.\n\nMenon stressed:\n\nUnless something dramatic happens in the Budget this year, we don’t see a steady recovery in trading volumes anytime soon.\n\n“Indian users have not been too badly affected by FTX except for the sentiment. The negative sentiment around the sector got exaggerated by FTX,” a top crypto exchange executive told the publication. The person elaborated:\n\nIndian investors, after TDS, have moved to Binance and not FTX because Binance had peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, FTX doesn’t. If you have INR, the only foreign exchanges you can trade on are Binance and Kucoin.\n\nSogani similarly explained that the FTX meltdown hurt “the sentiment across crypto tokens.” He added: “What came out later on has pushed the crypto industry behind by a few years.”\n\nMeanwhile, India still has not come up with a policy on crypto. The Indian government is planning to discuss crypto regulations with the G20 countries in an effort to establish a technology-driven regulatory framework for crypto assets, the country’s finance minister previously revealed. The government recently updated parliament on the status of its cryptocurrency bill.\n\nIndia’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has continued to push for the banning of all cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ether.

He explained that the British central bank plans to step up its effort with new laws to regulate crypto trading following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.\n\n“Trading of crypto assets was not big enough to destabilize the financial system, but it was starting to develop links,” Cunliffe said, elaborating:\n\nWe had banks and investment funds and others who wanted to invest in it and I think we should think about regulation before it becomes integrated with the financial system and before we could have a potential systemic problem.\n\nThe Bank of England deputy governor noted that trading in crypto should be regulated rather than banned.\n\nWhile cautioning that many coins were little more than a “gamble” and most were “without intrinsic value,” he admitted: “There are people who want to engage in that activity.” The BOE official clarified: “Provided they do that with their eyes wide open in a place that is safe, is not full of money laundering or illicit finance … then we should provide them at least with the opportunity to do that.”\n\nCunliffe opined:\n\nIf we’re talking about creating the regulation in which people can see whether they can develop services that have benefits using those technologies to the real economy … then I think there’s a real benefit for the U.K.\n\nHowever, he cautioned: “If we’re talking about using these crypto technologies to create, basically, crypto assets that have nothing behind them … I don’t think there’s ever going to be a sustainable financial activity around that.”\n\nIn November, Cunliffe said the collapse of crypto exchange FTX highlighted the urgent need for tighter crypto regulation.

The assets on each respective chain will get further utilized, and their value increase will not lag far behind. \n- Enriched in-app experiences: there are already lots of Web3 apps but they have pretty high barriers to entry. In order to achieve mass adoption, the user experience should be much simpler (with the same level of security of course). In fact, this is what a lot of Web3 developers are working on right now, and maybe in 2023 we’ll see much more general public getting into Web3 space – which will inevitably drive the market up;\n- US Regulation: It is only a matter of time before specific laws are put in place to properly regulate the crypto industry and allow big and small players in the space to finally gain clarity and prevent themselves from being sued at some point.

He wrote Monday:\n\nThe fact that bitcoin fell along with financial assets doesn’t mean that it will rise once those markets turn.\n\n“Bitcoin isn’t a financial asset. It’s a collectable digital token,” Schiff continued. “The bitcoin bubble popped and collectors will be selling no matter what happens to financial assets.”\n\nThe economist also believes that bitcoin is not scarce despite the cryptocurrency’s 21 million supply cap. Responding to a tweet Tuesday stating that BTC is “the scarcest and most desirable asset the world has ever seen,” Schiff said:\n\nBitcoin is hardly scarce and in no way desirable. If you want to lose your money there are plenty of ways to do it. You don’t need to buy bitcoin.\n\nReplying to another tweet claiming that bitcoin is a risk asset rather than digital gold, Schiff claimed that BTC is “More like a fool’s asset.” He asserted: “So, as long as people are foolish enough to buy bitcoin, the price will go up.

In fact, one of the priorities which have been put on the table is to help countries build a consensus for policy approach to crypto assets.\n\nThe collapse of crypto exchange FTX has led to calls for better oversight of the crypto market.

The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection captured the most sales this week but on Wednesday afternoon, the floor value tied to Cryptopunks once again jumped above the floor value associated with the BAYC NFT collection.\n\nFrom last Wednesday up until today, $154.78 million in sales were recorded over the last seven days which is 27.72% higher than the week prior. The $154 million in NFT sales over the last week came from 184,248 NFT buyers and 886,605 blockchain transactions according to cryptoslam metrics.\n\nOnce again Ethereum NFT sales dominate as the chain saw $129.99 million in NFT sales out of the $154 million seven-day aggregate. NFT sales from ETH jumped 37.73% higher than ETH-based NFT sales last week. Besides Ethereum, NFT sales from Solana, Immutable X, Polygon, and Cardano followed. In addition to Ethereum’s NFT sales increase, Immutable X NFT sales rose 5.20% higher than the week prior.\n\nThe top collection in terms of seven-day NFT sales was BAYC as the collection captured $21.84 million in sales this past week. BAYC is followed by Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), Valhalla, Cockpunch by Tim Ferriss, and Azuki. The most expensive NFT sold this week was sold five days ago for $691K and the NFT was BAYC #441.

I believe in it,” the rock legend affirmed. Noting that he has several cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum, Simmons stressed: “Personally, I’m holding, but everybody should do their own due diligence.”\n\nRock legend Gene Simmons confirmed Thursday that he is still holding cryptocurrencies despite the crypto winter and the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Simmons is an Israeli-born American musician, singer, songwriter, actor, and producer. He was the frontman, bassist, and co-lead singer of Kiss, the rock band he co-founded with lead singer and guitarist Paul Stanley.\n\nResponding to a question from Crypto Housewife at his Moneybag Vodka launch event in Alberta, Canada, about whether he is “still hodling” his cryptocurrencies, Simmons said: “Well, I’m not gonna suggest or recommend anything. I’m not a financial advisor.” The rock legend added:\n\nBut since you’re asking me, yes, I’m deep in crypto. I believe in it. I’ve got bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, quite a few others … Personally, I’m holding, but everybody should do their own due diligence.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of bitcoin is down about 64% year-to-date while ether has fallen 66%.

The proposal announced on Thursday concerns all service providers facilitating transactions in crypto assets for customers residing in the EU, not only those that are based there.\n\nAt the moment, tax authorities in the bloc lack the information needed to monitor proceeds obtained by using cryptocurrencies, the European Commission (EC) insisted. They are limited in their ability to ensure levies are paid effectively while Europeans lose tax revenues, it stated.\n\nThe new regulations, meant to complement the Markets in Crypto-assets legislation and the anti-money laundering rules agreed upon earlier this year, should improve the ability of member states to detect and counter tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, the Commission elaborated.\n\nThe reporting requirements will apply to all crypto service providers, regardless of their size and location, which process transactions of clients residing in the EU. “Serious non-compliance” will trigger penalties with a set minimum level valid across the Union.\n\n“Our proposal will ensure that member states get the information they need to ensure that taxes are paid on gains made in trading or investing crypto assets,” commented Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni. “It is also fully consistent with the OECD initiative on the Crypto Asset Reporting Framework,” he added.\n\nThe plan is to impose the new obligations on the crypto sector through amendments to the Directive for Administration Cooperation (DAC). The EC also suggested extending them to cover e-money and other digital currencies.\n\nThe draft proposal will be submitted to the European Parliament for consultations and to the Council of the European Union for adoption.

On Dec. 2, the CEO and founder of Morgan Creek Capital, Mark Yusko, explained in an interview that it’s quite possible that the FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was merely a “pawn” or “useful idiot” leveraged to “punish the industry.”\n\nSince the Terra LUNA fallout and the great number of business failures that followed the event, there’s been a myriad of theories surrounding these subjects. The most recent FTX collapse seems to eclipse all the blunders that took place after the Terra crash, and there are still many unanswered questions surrounding the event. A variety of individuals have shared their two cents about the FTX fiasco, including the host of CNBC’s Mad Money show, Jim Cramer, Galaxy Digital’s CEO Mike Novogratz, Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), and Tesla’s CEO and Twitter chief, Elon Musk.\n\nOn Friday, Mark Yusko, the CEO and founder of Morgan Creek Capital Management, told Kitco’s lead anchor and editor-in-chief Michelle Makori that Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was a “pawn.” “They are just pawns in a very large, very elaborate system that was designed to do money laundering,” Yusko told Kitco’s lead anchor. “It is certainly possible that there was an intent by someone to have this be an example set so that regulators could come in and punish the industry,” he added. Yusko explained to Makori that decentralized finance, also known as defi, threatens traditional finance.\n\nUnlike traditional finance, which is typically controlled by large banks and financial institutions, defi is decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by any single entity. Bitcoin (BTC) and defi challenges concepts like fiat currency and central planning, Yusko informed the Kitco broadcast host. Yusko and many crypto proponents believe defi offers a number of benefits, including greater accessibility, transparency, and security. “Blockchain replaces trust with truth,” Yusko explained to Makori.\n\n“Who are the arbiters of trust today? Financial institutions, third-party middle people, a $7 trillion industry,” Yusko elaborated. “They would like to not be disrupted by defi and digital assets. It is possible that some group of incumbents might have tried to lobby for regulation to delay, obfuscate or change the course of this disruption.”\n\nYusko also pointed out that it’s possible “someone above” SBF or Alameda Research’s Caroline Ellison worked to achieve a common goal, at the expense of the crypto industry. “This debacle is a fraud perpetrated by, I believe, someone above the useful idiots. Those two are not playing 10D chess,” the Morgan Creek CEO expounded. “Very large sums of money went to political candidates. There is evidence of Sam Bankman-Fried saying that he was going to give $1 billion in the next election,” Yusko added.\n\nYusko is extremely bullish on bitcoin (BTC) and in a May 6, 2020 interview, the Morgan Creek CEO said he expected the leading crypto asset to tap $250,000 in five years. During the discussion, Yusko also opined that bitcoin’s price could reach $400K to $500K as well. During his interview with Makori, Yusko noted that the U.S. could risk becoming stagnant if it over-regulates the industry. “If we become overly onerous regulatorily, crypto will just pop up in other jurisdictions,” Yusko said. “So, ultimately, crypto will win.”",2022-12-06T19:00:03.000Z

European leaders assert that the adoption of MiCA will lead to the creation of “harmonized rules for crypto-assets at the E.U. level.”\n\nAccording to a Nov. 29 briefing by the parliament’s think tank, the harmonized crypto rules are expected to provide “legal certainty for crypto-assets not covered by existing EU legislation.” In the briefing, the EP also argues that the rules will not only enhance the protection of consumers and investors but will also “promote innovation and use of crypto-assets.”\n\nThrough MICA, European authorities also hope “to regulate the issuance and trading of crypto-assets as well as the management of the underlying assets.”\n\nWhile European leaders like European Central Bank president Christine Largade are pushing for tougher regulation — MiCA II — some critics of the proposed legislation argue that the envisaged regulations in their current form may stifle innovation.\n\nCommenting on the European Union’s drive to regulate cryptocurrencies, Paulius Vaitkevicius, founder and crypto counselor at the law firm VILP Solutions, said the prevailing “Wild West environment” is not helpful to all parties. He also told Bitcoin News that without guidelines or regulatory frameworks “and with a number of situations where industry players collapse, we might end up in a situation where we will have only a handful of investors left in the industry.”\n\nTherefore, to stop this from happening the crypto industry needs legal clarity, which according to Vaitkevicius, “brings in more mature players to the industry from both project and investor sides.” Explaining why he is in favor of regulating the industry, Vaitkevicius said:\n\nFrom my personal experience, such players have been seeking regulations and clarity already for some time and waiting for the right moment to step in properly. With regulations, we will see these firm steps and as a result additional capital and talent coming to the industry space.\n\nMeanwhile, some crypto opponents have said if appropriate regulatory frameworks were already in place, Sam Bankman-Fried’s shenanigans would have been exposed much earlier. However, when asked about the validity of this argument, Vaitkevicius said the opinion that on paper FTX itself was “one of the most regulated players in the industry” undermines this theory. He added:\n\n“Regulation is a good step forward, but this needs to be followed by other elements to be functional in real-life situations and achieve the pursued goals.”",2022-12-03T17:00:10.000Z

The objective of this grants program is to support the Web3 gaming community in these times of market downturn and to advance the adoption of blockchain gaming on several chains.\n\nGame7, a Web3 gaming-dedicated project which has already supported projects on different chains including Arbitrum, Polygon, Immutable X, and Solana, has announced the launch of a $100 million grants program to support Web3 gaming companies. The chain-agnostic project announced that the objective of this move is to offer support to these initiatives to push the Web3 gaming ecosystem forward even in unfavorable times for the crypto industry.\n\nThe organization, which is a DAO supported by Bitdao and Forte, aims to distribute these funds over the next five years to the best projects presenting their initiatives. The grants will be distributed among five different areas, including technology, events, diversity, education, and research.\n\nOn the direction of these funds, Game7 contributor Ronen Kirsh declared:\n\nImproving smart contract standards, tooling, interoperable wallets, and scaling solutions will be crucial on the path to global adoption of Web3 games. We have allocated 20% of our committed treasury to fund each of these crucial components so the gaming industry can focus on building sustainable game economies.\n\nThe first sector to receive grants will be the tech area, which will focus on supporting teams preparing open-source development in certain key areas, including game development tooling, smart contracts and standards, core infrastructure, and community tooling. Game7 grants support goes beyond just economic assistance, as it includes access to tech support, mentoring, and early access to Game7 initiatives.\n\nGame7 believes in Web3 gaming as a force that can empower gamers and gaming companies alike, allowing them to benefit and grow together. This is according to John Allen, a representative of Bitdao, who stated:\n\nWe believe this new model of games within a world where users and developers are aligned, has the potential to grant greater distribution of equity and ownership.\n\nWeb3 gaming has been one of the few areas of the cryptocurrency world that have continued to grow even amid the economic woes the industry faces, according to a report issued in September by Dappradar.

The authority has tried to clarify the matter, noting that the digital coins may be subject to other regulations.\n\nIn response to multiple requests for clarification from citizens and businesses, Belgium’s Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) has explained why it believes bitcoin, ether and other similar cryptocurrencies cannot be considered securities or investment instruments.\n\nAccording to its position published on Thursday, the country’s securities laws do not apply to such digital assets, which have no issuer and are created by a computer code as opposed to the execution of an agreement between an issuer and an investor.\n\nHowever, the regulatory body pointed out that if these crypto assets have a payment or exchange function, if they are exchangeable or fungible, other regulations may be applicable to them as well as to the persons that are providing certain related services.\n\nThe FSMA further remarked that despite the lack of specific legislation, cryptocurrencies can be equated to securities if they are incorporated into financial instruments and have an issuer such as an individual or a legal entity.\n\nSeeking to provide assistance to interested parties, that have been sending more and more questions about the financial rules concerning crypto assets, the authority has adopted a “stepwise plan” to offer a series of guidelines for their classification.\n\nThe Belgian financial watchdog emphasized that the plan is neutral regarding technology. “The qualification as security, financial instrument or investment instrument does not depend on the technology that is being used,” it elaborated, adding that it’s ready to update the plan in order to reflect regulatory changes in the future.\n\nOne such event could be the upcoming adoption of the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, which was agreed upon by European institutions and member states at the end of June.

According to reports, the project identified as 4.401/2021 will be on the agenda for being discussed by the Chamber of Deputies, marked as urgent, and listed to be discussed on Nov. 22.\n\nThe Brazilian cryptocurrency bill, a project that seeks to regulate the actions of cryptocurrency exchanges and custody agents, as well as establish clear cryptocurrency mining rules, will be on the agenda of the Chamber of Deputies next week. The bill, which had been sidelined before the general ballot that happened on Oct. 20, is slated to be discussed on Nov. 22.\n\nThe bill might be discussed and voted on if the chamber decides that it is of importance, as the document is the fourth item in the list to be discussed in that session. Still, deputies can change the agenda of the day, and postpone the discussion of the bill, as has happened in several opportunities before.\n\nAccording to local reports, there might be a window of opportunity for the project to be discussed, due to the laws that are currently being discussed in the Senate. However, others key actors have disregarded this possibility, as president Lula’s takeover might bring important changes to the budget law for 2023, requiring attention from both chambers.\n\nThe events surrounding the withdrawal pause and the subsequent bankruptcy of FTX, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, made several personalities in the cryptocurrency industry in Brazil touch on the importance of the approval of the bill.\n\nRoberto Dagnoni, CEO of 2TM, the holding company of Mercado Bitcoin, one of the biggest exchanges in Brazil, stated:\n\nIf there is a good side, it would be that it gets the law prioritized. The rules that currently exist have not been applicable to some players, so they can do whatever you want. This (law) would change a lot.\n\nBrazil is one of the countries that have been more affected by FTX’s debacle. Per Coingecko’s numbers, Brazil would be the tenth more affected country on the list, with Brazilians already organizing to take legal action in several jurisdictions. A proposed class action lawsuit will group customers with more than $100,000 on the exchange to try to recoup some of the losses.",2022-11-21T17:00:11.000Z

The close associate of the crypto pyramid’s mastermind left the Russian Federation as the scam collapsed last summer.\n\nZygmunt Zygmuntovich, a co-founder and high-ranking representative of arguably the largest Ponzi scheme in Russia since MMM in the 1990s, has been captured in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the Russian portal “Business Online” reported on Thursday. The arrest has been confirmed by Russia’s Prosecutor General’s Office.\n\nAccording to the publication, the 24-year-old man, a German national, has been held in a prison in the Gulf state since early September. Russian prosecutors told the news outlet they were informed about his detention by the local Interpol bureau. Russia has already filed an extradition request with the country’s Ministry of Justice which is currently under consideration by the competent authorities in Abu Dhabi.\n\nZygmuntovich was put on an international wanted list when Russian law enforcement launched a criminal investigation into the fraudulent investment scheme, along with Marat Sabirov and Edward Sabirov, two other associates of Finiko’s founder Kirill Doronin, who has been in jail since July 2021. The three men managed to leave Russia as the financial Pyramid was crumbling.\n\nThe whereabouts of the Sabirovs are unknown at this point in time and the exact circumstances in which Zygmuntovich was arrested are also unclear. But knowledgeable sources have told “Business Online” that his two former partners might have tipped off security forces about his location.\n\nDefendants in the criminal case are another 22 people, including Finiko’s top promoters. Among them are two women, Lilia Nurieva and Dina Gabdullina, as well as Finiko’s Vice President and Doronin’s right-hand man, Ilgiz Shakirov, who was arrested in the Russian Republic of Tatarstan where the Ponzi scheme was based. Last November, Finiko’s mastermind offered to testify against 44 of his accomplices.\n\nAccording to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Finiko members and executives have attracted at least 5 billion rubles (over $80 million) to the pyramid but the actual total of the losses is likely much higher. The money came from defrauded investors in Russia and several other countries in the former Soviet space, EU nations Germany, Austria, and Hungary, the U.S., and elsewhere.\n\nMany of the victims were asked to send cryptocurrency to wallet addresses controlled by Finiko, a phantom entity. According to a report by blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis, the pyramid received more than $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin between December 2019 and August 2021. The coins were transferred in 800,000 deposits by people lured with promises of monthly returns of up to 30%.",2022-11-18T17:00:08.000Z

The talks with national treasuries are expected to start next year with the aim to end the differentiated tax treatment of cryptocurrencies across the bloc’s 27 jurisdictions.\n\nThe executive body in Brussels, the European Commission, intends to soon launch talks with the financial ministries of the member states on whether establishing a Union-wide tax regime for crypto is warranted, a report by Politico revealed Thursday, quoting three EU officials.\n\nThe discussions are set to begin in 2023, the sources told the publication. Their focus will be on sharing best practices as currently cryptocurrency wealth is subject to different taxes in each country. Commenting on the initiative, a spokesperson for the Commission elaborated:\n\nDifficulties in classifying, valuing and administering crypto assets pose challenges to tax administrations seeking to tax them fairly and effectively.\n\nBefore implementing a single tax regime, however, the European Union needs to introduce new requirements for crypto companies to collect details of digital asset owners, both individuals and businesses, and share them with tax authorities across the EU, the report remarks.\n\nThis would allow tax administrations to have a clear idea about crypto holdings. The European Commission is expected to propose such regulations in December or January but it is likely to start enforcing them in 2026, which will allow it to impose the crypto tax the following year.\n\nEuropean institutions have been working on a comprehensive legislative framework for cryptocurrencies called Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) which was agreed upon this summer. Media reports attributed a delay in its adoption to the need to translate the complex legal document into all official languages of the EU. MiCA should come into force in 2024.\n\nAt present, member states employ different rules to tax income and capital gains from crypto, with rates ranging between zero and 33%, Politico notes. Authorities in some European countries are revising policies in advance of a possible decision at the EU level.\n\nPortugal, for example, which was not taxing gains from crypto trading, unless they are part of a business activity, now intends to impose a levy on profits from short-term crypto investments starting from 2023. Traders who cash out any crypto gains made under a year will face a tax of 28%, according to the budget for next year.",2022-11-12T17:00:11.000Z

The idea has been circulated with a consultation paper published for public discussions on the development of the digital asset market in the Russian Federation.\n\nRussia’s monetary authority has published a report on the future of the Russian digital asset sector. The document explores the development of the market for digital financial assets (DFAs) and utility digital rights (UDRs), and legal terms partially covering cryptocurrencies and tokens — those with an issuing entity, in particular.\n\nThe Central Bank of Russia (CBR) believes that additional regulations are needed to improve the DFA framework and harmonize it with the rules that govern the traditional financial industry. According to the regulator, this would increase investment, circulation, and liquidity while ensuring better investor protection.\n\nTaxation is one the aspects reviewed in the consultation paper. The Bank of Russia proposes to offer tax incentives for investors holding long-term DFAs and UDRs, suggesting the adoption of a mechanism similar to a special tax regime that applies to holders of individual investment accounts. The latter was introduced with the aim to attract citizens’ free funds to the securities market.\n\nThe CBR believes its proposal would create new opportunities for Russian citizens and businesses, simplify transactions with digital assets and digital rights, and reduce operating costs. However, it notes that additional discussions with relevant government institutions and market participants are needed before approving such tax incentives.\n\nThe Russian central bank also wants to see improvements in the identification procedures applied to DFA holders. Quoted by RBC Crypto, the monetary policy regulator explained this would allow the country to let foreign DFAs enter its market, adopt regulations designed specifically for smart contracts, and develop necessary accounting procedures.\n\nAmong the other proposals for which the CBR is seeking feedback in the next month is the idea to facilitate the tokenization of various assets such as securities and bonds, precious stones and metals, property rights in the form of non-fungible tokens, and claims secured by mortgages. The Bank of Russia also wants the public discussions to cover the listing of digital assets on existing exchanges and digital asset transactions through intermediaries.\n\nRussia has been looking to expand its regulatory framework for DFAs and the institutional debate over the status of decentralized assets such as cryptocurrencies has been going on for months. While the central bank called for a blanket ban on crypto activities in January, it later agreed with the finance ministry in Moscow to legalize cross-border crypto payments. The change in its stance came amid increasing sanctions pressure over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine which started in late February.",2022-11-09T17:00:08.000Z

The billionaire explained that there is no choice since Twitter is losing over $4 million a day. “Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists,” he explained.\n\nTwitter’s new boss, Elon Musk, has laid off about 50% of employees at the social media company. The billionaire sent an email to all Twitter employees Thursday evening informing them whether their employment has been terminated.\n\n“In an effort to place Twitter on a healthy path, we will go through the difficult process of reducing our global workforce on Friday,” the letter states. “This action is unfortunately necessary to ensure the company’s success moving forward.”\n\nThe letter adds that by 9 a.m. PST on Friday, Nov. 4, “everyone will receive an individual email with the subject line: Your Role at Twitter … If your employment is not impacted, you will receive a notification via your Twitter email. If your employment is impacted, you will receive a notification with next steps via your personal email.” The letter continues:\n\nTo help ensure the safety of each employee as well as Twitter systems and customer data, our offices will be temporarily closed and all badge access will be suspended. If you are in an office or on your way to an office, please return home.\n\nMusk explained in a tweet Friday that the workforce reduction was inevitable since Twitter is losing over $4 million a day. However, he emphasized that everyone who was let go was offered three months of severance, noting that it is 50% more than the legally required amount.\n\nYoel Roth, Twitter’s head of safety and integrity, revealed Friday that Musk cut 50% of Twitter’s workforce company-wide. “Yesterday’s reduction in force affected approximately 15% of our Trust & Safety organization (as opposed to approximately 50% cuts company-wide), with our front-line moderation staff experiencing the least impact,” he tweeted. According to Twitter’s annual report, the company had over 7,500 full-time employees as of Dec. 31, 2021.\n\nTwitter employees filed a federal lawsuit Thursday accusing the social media giant of violating a federal law called the Work Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act that governs notice of employment termination.\n\nMusk also revealed in a tweet Friday that “Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue.” Before his takeover, the social media company reported making 90% of its revenue from advertisers. However, major companies have stopped advertising on the platform allegedly over concerns about how Musk will affect content moderation policies.\n\nThe billionaire claimed “activist groups pressuring advertisers” led to the revenue plunge, “even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists,” he tweeted Friday. “They’re trying to destroy free speech in America.”\n\nIn an effort to generate revenue for Twitter, Musk has decided to charge $8 a month for users to have a blue checkmark by their name.",2022-11-06T17:00:07.000Z

Furthermore, Alphabay relentlessly conducted business amid a domino effect of DNMs folding last year and throughout 2022.\n\nLast year, a number of DNMs left without a trace, like the world’s largest monero (XMR) accepting marketplace, White House, and the DNM Joker’s Stash. This year, a number of darknet marketplaces have dealt with casualties and it started with Europol’s takedown of Darkmarket in January. A month prior, the DNM Monopoly had gone offline but on Jan. 28, 2022, the DNM researcher Darkdotfail tweeted that “Monopoly Market’s servers were seized” and it was “very likely law enforcement action.”\n\nThrough the thick of it all, Alphabay (AB) has managed to become the world’s largest illicit marketplace on the deep web in 2022. The marketplace was also the largest DNM in 2017, but it was seized by international law enforcement on July 13, 2017. At that time, thousands of AB users flocked to both Hansa and Dream.\n\nLater, Thailand police revealed that Alexandre Cazes, the alleged administrator of Alphabay, was arrested. Days later, on July 18, 2017, Cazes was found dead in a Bangkok prison in the Laksi district. In addition to taking down AB and finding Cazes before he died, international law enforcement operated the DNM Hansa for more than 30 days before taking it down.\n\n49 months later in Aug. 2021, the popular DNM forum Dread started seeing appearances of the Alphabay co-founder “Desnake.” It was once thought that Cazes was Desnake but now it is assumed he may have been known as the AB co-founder “Alpha02.” In Aug. 2021, a former AB moderator called “disc0” vouched for Desnake, and reports started to appear about a newly launched Alphabay.\n\nIn Aug. 2022, AB celebrated its one-year anniversary return after the takedown in 2017 and Cazes’ death. The DNM operates in a different manner than it did back then, as the underground shop is hosted on both Tor and I2P. Anything to do with Russia is forbidden when it comes to products and services, and fentanyl is completely banned from the new AB marketplace. Like the retired White House DNM, the new Alphabay supports monero (XMR) transactions only.\n\nIn November 2022, discussions and threads found on the hidden Dread forum, and the clearnet Reddit forum r/darknet, show that AB is a very popular market. Besides AB, other popular DNMs in late 2022 include Tor2door Market, ASAP Market, Abacus Market, Archetyp, Darkfox Market, and Vice City. In Feb. 2022, the platform Dark0de exit scammed and the DNM World Market exit scammed during the first week of April.\n\nWhile the DNMs Darkmarket and Monopoly failed earlier in the year, last April German law enforcement agencies shut down Russia’s largest DNM, Hydra. After the fall of the original Alphabay in 2017, Russia’s DNM Hydra was a force to be reckoned with over the next few years before law enforcement shut it down. Reports had shown that Hydra’s complex drug delivery system overshadowed Western darknet markets.\n\nAlthough, the new AB is considered more sophisticated, in terms of privacy, by offering monero transactions, a feature called Alphaguard that claims to “safeguard” wallets in the event of server seizures, and I2P connections. Reports published by the threat intelligence blog Flashpoint Team further detail that “Desnake intends to morph Alphabay into a ‘decentralized market’” by 2023.",2022-11-04T17:00:11.000Z

On Oct. 28, the organization informed it had sent notifications to 3,997 taxpayers about incongruencies between their tax statements and reports on their cryptocurrency holdings. These statements being reviewed correspond to reports of operations happening in 2020.\n\nThe Argentine Tax Authority (AFIP) is using the reports coming from local exchanges to cross the data in the tax statements and the crypto holdings of several taxpayers and has already found incongruencies. According to reports, the organization has already sent notifications of these problems to 3,997 Argentine citizens, that will have the opportunity to correct their statements to include their cryptocurrency holdings and pay additional taxes.\n\nThese notifications would be linked to statements that were filed during 2020 and would be sent to taxpayers that have operated using local cryptocurrency exchanges, that must pass their operational information to the AFIP by law. The notifications explain that the taxpayer has been operating with cryptocurrency in these exchanges. It continues declaring:\n\nYou are reminded that the results derived from the disposal of digital currencies are covered by the Income Tax and, if applicable, you must proceed to externalize them in the relevant affidavits as well as their possession.\n\nHowever, asking for information and justification of the expenses and cryptocurrency purchases for taxpayers in 2020 might lead them to show the history of their cryptocurrency holdings since its purchase until that year. This might also derive from having to amend cryptocurrency statements of years before 2020.\n\nThese actions can lead to a possible seizure of bitcoin, which is still a controversial issue according to analysts. Daniel Perez, an Argentine attorney, believes that there are still no laws that allow the state to take control of these cryptocurrency wallets. In contrast, digital accounts can be seized, with the organization having seized more than 1,200 of these since Feb. In an interview with Iproup, he stated:\n\nThe law would have to be modified to clearly stipulate the possibility of seizing electronic wallets. The AFIP knows this, and that is why it is trying to sneak into the Budget an article that gives it the power to do so both with respect to fiat money and bitcoin.\n\nThe applicability of this new article would be also limited because it would only apply to cryptocurrency held in noncustodial wallet providers and exchanges. It is still uncertain the ways in which the state would force citizens to deliver their cryptocurrency private keys to government officials.",2022-10-31T17:00:10.000Z

Using a technique called typosquatting, which consists of registering domains that are dramatically near to the ones of official brands of organizations, hackers are getting data and private keys from unsuspected users, according to a report issued by Cyble.\n\nHackers have set up a net of malware-infected domains that take advantage of the typing inaccuracies of users when getting to a determined website. According to a report issued by Cyble, a cyber security and digital risk assessment firm, these domains mimic renowned organizations and apps, like the Google Play Store, Apkure, and Apkcombo, among others.\n\nUsers that visit the domains are prompted to download an infected version of the app requested, which will serve as a vehicle for the infection.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) traded at a discount of 15.87% to the trust's net asset value, reaching the level last seen in December 2021, according to YCharts. The discount has been steadily narrowing since reaching a record low of nearly 50% during the height of the bear market in December last year.\n\nThe latest improvement came as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided not to appeal against the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals' August verdict to set aside the regulator's decision to reject Grayscale's attempts to convert its trust into an ETF. The SEC had until Friday midnight to challenge the decision. ""As far as I know, the SEC did not appeal, which means it now has to reconsider its ruling. It could deny again for different reasons - but the agency is reportedly engaging with other potential issuers, which is unusual. It is starting to feel like it is getting ready to let them list,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the popular Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, said in the weekend edition.

But the opposite is happening. Economists have increasingly course corrected on their recession forecasts, bitcoin has doubled since crypto exchange FTX’s multibillion collapse, and Nvidia shares are soaring.\n\nThe standard playbook is starting to break down,” Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMEX and current Chief Investment Officer at Maelstrom, said during a keynote at Korea Blockchain Week attended by CoinDesk. Rising financial asset prices can boost capital gains taxes and government revenue, but when the Fed raises interest rates, these prices can stagnate, reducing tax revenue, Hayes opined. “All the while, this, coupled with the political hostility of austerity, increases deficits, leading the U.S. Treasury to issue more bonds.

This should produce some interesting market dynamics.\n🔆 It is expected (though this should not be taken as a prediction of future performance) that Dublr will transition from minting new coins on the mint price curve to trading with an effectively fixed supply, once sufficient supply has been created and mint price becomes exorbitant.\n🔆 The DUBLR token utilizes a new ultra-secure ERC20 implementation, and has passed security audits by two separate auditing companies (Omniscia and SolidProof)\n\nRead the Dublr whitepaper here:\n👉🏻 https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dublr/dublr/raw/main/whitepaper.pdf\n\nTo buy/sell DUBLR tokens:\n1️⃣ Buy MATIC tokens on an exchange, and transfer via Polygon network to a private wallet (e.g. MetaMask)\n2️⃣ Browse to the Dublr dapp: https://dublr.github.io/\n3️⃣ Connect the dapp to your wallet, using the blue button near the top\n4️⃣ Follow the instructions on the ""Buy"" and ""Sell"" tabs\n\nNote that in order to make Dublr safe for use, Dublr goes out of its way to not be classified as a security by US SEC laws, which requires at least the following:\n✅ The creator of Dublr minted no tokens for themself (initial supply: 0). All supply will be community-owned. This is unprecedented in the history of fungible tokens.\n✅ No promise of profits is given (or can be given) to purchasers of DUBLR tokens, since price is entirely defined by supply vs. demand.\n✅ In particular, the name ""Dublr"" refers only to the growth of the mint price, not to the price at which DUBLR tokens may be sold for (the mint price curve sets only an upper bound on price growth, not a lower bound).\n✅ Dublr is launched on the Polygon network, not Ethereum mainnet, since the US SEC Chairman recently declared the entire Ethereum ecosystem to be a security, falling under US jurisdiction.",2022-11-10T02:03:57.000Z

BTC still stuck below the Monthly resistance range till 37k and once BTC clears this level then it can easily hunt Buy Side Liquidity around 40k - 45k. However there is still unmitigated liquidity below 24.8k -19.5k since the beginning of 2023. Trust me Market Algorithms never leave the liquidity behind for long.\n\nSo Plan is simple if BTC corrects and accepted below 30500 then we may see the unmitigated liquidity around 24.8k - 19.5k gets mitigated otherwise 40k -44k coming.\n\n@cryptosignals,2023-11-01T07:45:20.000Z

6579c68b9c8c4517bf26f133,657982e5660a918f6a6e4b67,CryptSignalToday,"#BTC #Bitcoin\n\nBTC is now below its 1W MA200 for the first time since the Mar 2020 COVID crash. As I've mentioned numerous times, that has been the trend-line that marked the bottoms on both previous BTC Bear Cycles (all candles closed above).\n\nOn this analysis, I am extending analysis on the Support by adding a variety of elements:\n\n1) The Weekly MA300, which was the level that got hit, supported the price and initiated the rally on the March 2020 COVID crash.\n2) The Mayer MA, which fits perfectly on this Support Zone charting I want to make clear with the MA200 and MA300.\n3) Mapping of all previous Cycles\n4) The Halvings\n\n\nWeekly MA300 \nFirst, it is critical to acknowledge where the Weekly MA300 is. On this INDEX BTC chart, it sits around 16590. That is way below the Top of the previous Bear Cycle (19800), which if broken it will be the first time in history. If the current Weekl candle closes considerably below the Weekly MA200, a trader should acknowledge that as a possibility. Notice however that this is the top of the Mayer MA Support Band (Blue zone), which was last hit on the Aug 2015 candle.\n\n\n The Halvings can time the Bottoms \nThe good news come when we incorporate the Halvings on the chart. As you see, the previous Bear Cycle bottoms have been 882 and 791 days after the previous Halving for the December 2018 and the January 2015 bottoms respectively. Or alternatively 518 and 539 days before the next Halving. Right now that creates a potential Bottom Phase within the July 04 and October 03 2022 1W candles.\n\n\nWeekly MA50/MA100 Cross\n \nOn top of that, there is a pattern that when formed, it basically confirms that the Cycle's Bottom has been priced. That is the Weekly MA50/MA100 Cross (when the Weekly MA50 crosses below the Weekly MA100 . I've analyzed that before but it fits very well on the current idea. If the MA50 and MA100 don't diverge from their current course, the Cross is projected to take place within the Bottom Phase as illustrated by the Halvings.\n\n\nCycle Mapping\n\nEven though the current Cycle has been an odd one, especially when thinking about its top, which not only it didn't make a blow-off top above the upper Mayer MA Zone (red zone) but also made a slightly higher top in Nov, it hasn't diverged much from the previous ones. As you see if we divide the Bear Cycles into phases, they all tend to follow the same pattern:\n\na) Blue Triangle = Blow-off phase but with price still supported by the wekly MA50 \nb) Green Rectangle = Price consolidating, below the Weekly MA50 but supported by the Weekly MA100.\nc) Orange Channel Down = Final sell-off/ price collapsing below the Weekly MA100 but finds support and contained above the Weekly MA200.\n\nWe are currently on Phase C. Whether or not BTC hits the 1W MA300 now or in a later stage of the new Bull Cycle, as it did on both previous Cycles (see red circles), that remains to be seen.\n\nSo bottom is around 16K -18k but MA 50 need to cross Ma 100 for confirmation. personally i am loading spot positions along with 50% positions in BUSD for fuckery that may come due to inflation rising higher and higher",2022-06-20T14:33:26.000Z

AirDAO has embraced a community-first ethos and is now empowering its global community to take the reins of its future. This groundbreaking shift marks a significant leap forward for AirDAO and decentralization in web3. \n\nAirDAO will adopt a flat DAO structure, decentralizing its leadership and eliminating traditional roles such as ‘Director’ and ‘CEO.’ The AirDAO blockchain will no longer be maintained, controlled, or built by a single developer or development company. Instead, AirDAO will be developed and governed by the people, for the people.\n\nThe community will elect a nine-member AirDAO Council. This council will assume control over AirDAO’s finances, operational budget, and blockchain core-engineer multi-signature wallet in the coming weeks. By May 31st, 2023; the council will have complete control over all AirDAO assets and convene regular meetings to make roadmap and operational decisions.\n\nThe AirDAO community will nominate candidates and conduct the AirDAO Council voting process with fairness and transparency ensured through on-chain voting. The community will also shape the council’s role, establish rules, draft the AirDAO constitution, and develop the voting process. The internal AirDAO team will support the community during the formation process and council elections.\n\nLang Mei — the current Director of AirDAO — will oversee the change to decentralized leadership during the transition period. By May 31st, 2023, his CEO/Director role will be retired, allowing the elected council to assume total control of the roadmap, HR, financial, and operational decisions.\n\nA community-led web3 ecosystem thrives on active participation. AirDAO invites everyone to play an instrumental role in shaping its future. Get involved in the governance process, contribute to AirDAO development, vote in the council elections, and be the change you want to see.\n\nDYOR: Telegram | Twitter",2023-05-11T11:15:15.000Z

Scalable business. Business(es) in which costs decrease as it grows.\n\n→ A small burger joint, can't dictate terms from suppliers\n→ But Mcdonald's has economies of scale to negotiate minimum prices and exclusive terms\n\nin CRYPTO:\n→ Smaller miners reduce profitability/ incur losses on inefficiencies with power supply, parts repair, infrastructure  \n→ Large miners are able to level out increasing complexity, repairs and upgrades through infrastructure and more favorable terms.\n\n2. Network effect. Network effect. The value of the business increases due to the instantaneous involvement of other people.\n\n→ It took about $50k dollars to create Tinder. Later it was sold for $3bn due to huge user base.\n\nIn CRYPTO: Ethereum\n→ Ability to program trustless code \n→ Ability to send and transfer assets in a matter of moments\n→ Unique decentralized dApps\n\n3. new business models. \n\nExisting large corporations cannot adopt some technology solutions because it will destroy some of their existing business.\n\n→ Kodak invented digital cameras in the 1970s, and never decided to mass launch them because it could hurt their analog business.\n\nin CRYPTO: Music NFTs\n→ The record labels could benefit from Music NFT if they wanted to, but it would put them out of business since they get paid for mediating.\n\n4. The price of switching to a competitor. This is when a customer loses value and goes to others.\n\nI only use Apple products - getting Apple out of my life means losing a bunch of super handy apps, spending a lot of useful time learning new and not always handy software, tweaking the ecosystem and getting weaker IT security. \n\nin CRYPTO: Metamask (+30mln users)\n→ There are many Web 3 wallets now, but MetaMask remains dominant. Why? Because people are so used to Metamask that it's already hard to switch to a more convenient Web3 solution.\n\n5. Branding. The power of branding allows companies to charge a premium price.\n\n→ Is there a difference in how a Rolex or a dishman noname tell time? No.\n→ Does a Chanel bag hold things better than a Michael Kors bag? No.\n\nThat's why the biggest companies invest so much in branding and meaning.\n\nin CRYPTO: Polygon / Bored Ape Yacht Club\n→ Polygon has connected brands like Nike, Starbucks, Reddit and Face**ok to Web3.\n→ Anyone can build a collection of 10,000 freaks. And only a few brands are in the big leagues. BAYC has become mainstream.\n\n6. Access to key resources. Empires used to fight over spices, salt, silk and gold. The modern world is fighting for oil and semiconductors. DeFi protocols fight for liquidity.\n\nIn CRYPTO: The Curve Wars\n→ Curve controls most of the liquidity in DeFi.\n→ Protocols compete for veCRV tokens because it allows more liquidity for their tokens.\n\n7. Autonomy of processes.\n\n→ For example, Toyota created its Toyota production line to eliminate waste and improve the quality of its cars.\n→ TikTok has its own personal display algorithm, making it independent of other developments.\n\nin CRYPTO: Its own capital efficiency algorithms in Uniswap V3 and Curve Finance.\n→ Uniswap V3 - its concentrated liquidity model represents a capital efficiency process.\n→ Curve Finance - StableSwap invariant formula.\n\n🤖 If you are the founder of a startup or an established company, read these points again, maybe you will see new points of growth.",2023-01-18T11:41:09.000Z

Consumers could therefore monetize their data individually, and create “more equitable digital ecosystem.” Paxos wrote:\n\n💬 “All of these benefits also happen to be the pillars of a sound financial system. These benefits will continue to become important as other industries utilize the technology to meet the demands of today’s—and tomorrow’s—consumers.”",2023-08-31T17:30:30.000Z

Residential rates start at just under $11.30 per MWh.\n\n🔔 The rate rise puts crypto mining in the same energy price bracket as heavy industries, and above the levels paid by commercial enterprises. The revised rates come into force on August 1, and will run until October 31, 2023, when they could be changed again. \n\n⚠️ Differentiated electricity rates for crypto miners are a relatively new phenomenon in Argentina.

Similarly, SHIB surged by over 1,250% during the 2021 cryptocurrency bull market after gaining tailwind popularity from its sister Dogecoin token. Despite the recent traction, OKX staff wrote in its Pepe listing announcement: 👇\n\n“Digital assets are innovative investment products with high price fluctuations and risks.

Kovač made the announcement following Kwon’s arrest at Montenegro’s Podgorica airport on March 23, adding the Terra co-founder’s detainment had been extended to 30 days.\n\n🌸“In the case when we receive several extradition requests, I would like to say that determining to which state they will be extradited is based on several factors like the severity of the committed criminal offense, the location and time when the criminal offense has been committed, the order in which we have received the request for extradition and several other factors,” said Kovač through an interpreter.\n\nKovač said 😇decisions regarding custody of Kwon will go to Montenegro’s high court.

FedNow, which will launch as a pilot project later this year, will provide real-time, round-the-clock payment service.\n\n🖐Tassat will serve as a business-to-business onramp for FedNow through a client-facing application programming interface (API), CEO Kevin Greene told Cointelegraph. Both the company’s interbank and intrabank services will provide FedNow access.\n\nThe FedNow pilot is expected to begin in June or July with a small number of banks. The system will offer real-time gross settlement by funneling commercial bank money from a sender through a Fed credit account to its recipient. It is often seen as a non-blockchain alternative to central bank digital currency (CBDC) and to stablecoin.\n\nFedNow will initially be available only for domestic transfer, which suited Greene. “We have a lot of work to do here in America,” he said.

The same day, the DAI stablecoin depegged as part of the ongoing USD Coin destabilization, which was, in turn, caused by $3.3 billion in stuck stablecoin collateral deposits owed to its issuer Circle by now-defunct Silicon Valley Bank. \n\nGHST is described as an ""entry ticket"" into Aavegotchi, where users can use the token to purchase NFT portals, wearables, consumables within the Aavegotchi game, stake to farm rewards, or participate in DAO governance. The Aavegotchi bonding curve was created on Sept. 14, 2020, with an opening price of 0.2 DAI per GHST.\n\n🤪When users purchase GHST via DAI, the bonding curve smart contract, powered by Aragon, ensures new GHST tokens are minted and vice versa. However, when a GHST token is purchased, each subsequent buyer will have to pay a slightly higher price for each token, leading to GHST having a higher market cap than its DAI reserve. \n\nIn what was essentially a multi-year token sale, the protocol has received a total of 30.3 million DAI. Developers first proposed in January that the DAI funds should be distributed for protocol liquidity, the Aavegotchi DAO, and its parent Pixelcraft Studios on a 20/40/40 basis. \n\nWith the bond curve now removed, the exchange rate of GHST is now free floating and no longer determined by DAI. At the time of publication, the token's value has plunged by 18.09% in the past 24 hours to $1.12 apiece. Meanwhile, the price of DAI stablecoin has fallen 6.76% in the past 24 hours to $0.9314 apiece. Though no longer linked, the proceeds received from the token sale suffered a material loss due to the DAI depegging event.

The spike has been caused by anticipation surrounding the next Binance burn update, with the exchange set to report today on how much LUNC it has burned since last November.\n\n🆕Despite today's spike, LUNC remains up by only 4% in the last 30 days. However, if Binance's update does reveal the large burn count that many are expecting, LUNC could see further gains in the coming days. \n\n⏳LUNC's indicators suggest that now may be a very good time to buy. Its relative strength index (purple) has jumped from just under 50 to 70 in the past few hours, signalling some very strong buying momentum. \nEncouragingly, LUNC's 30-day moving average (red) has begun rising up towards its 200-day average (blue). That it remains below the longer term average could mean that this rally has plenty of time left before it runs out of steam.\n\n🆙If LUNC can break the $0.0000175 resistance level the rally could reach new levels. It did temporarily breach this level this morning, yet it came back down, suggesting that it may still be a little early for a breakout.",2023-03-02T19:00:04.000Z

However, critics argue the proposed regulations would negatively impact the cryptocurrency sector as a whole by threatening consumer privacy and ultimately extending government overreach. \n\n➡️ The proposed regulation has been criticized for its use of the term broker, which includes “a dealer, a barter exchange, and any other person who (for a consideration) regularly acts as a middleman with respect to property or services.” Critics argue that the definition is too vague given the wide variety of entities that could be classified under the same umbrella.\n\n💬 “The Proposed Regulations interpret the term “broker” to include “digital asset middleman,” a vague and expansive category of market participants that bears little resemblance to the persons historically considered brokers,” a comment reads in part from the DeFi Education Fund.\n\n💬 “The IRS is so fixated on retrieving customers’ personally identifiable information (PII) and ensuring taxes are properly reported that is ignoring the costs of over-reporting,” states a comment from American for Tax Reform. “This goes beyond what is required of traditional brokers.”",2023-11-14T18:01:44.000Z

In just two months, the Sundae token's value has increased from $0.25 to $4, making its many followers 16 times richer.\n\nWe'd like to remind you – this is at least the third mention by Musk of some ""ice cream."" The first mention  miraculously coincided with the listing on MEXC.\n\nSo, what is Sundae? What's the secret behind the rapid token's value growth during such a depressive period of bear market rally?\n\nThe secret of this growth partly lies in rumors that Sundae senators have established an accumulation fund where about 30% of the token's sales profit goes.\n\nThe fund plans to invest in various sources of income, such as trust funds, media, online schools, IT companies, digital agencies, and even immortal canvases by world-famous authors.\n\nThe project has all chances to become revolutionary, as evidenced by its listing on major exchanges like MEXC and Bitget, the participation of bloggers with a million-strong audience and funds that previously invested in the current market ""monsters.""\n\nOne of the Odyssey co-founders explains: ""Sundae means 'ice cream dessert.' Yesterday, the token cost only $0.25, less than ice cream. Today it's already $4, and tomorrow it could be worth thousands. Can you buy your secure future at the price of an ice cream?

As part of the Fahrenheit Consortium, the company worked with numerous other investors and crypto businesses, including Arrington Capital, in May to win an auction for Celsius – a crypto lending firm that went bankrupt four months before FTX. \n\n🟠 According to a source contacted by Bloomberg, Proof has already approached other investors to gauge potential interest in the bid. CoinDesk was the first to report Proof’s bid on Monday.\n\n⚠️ Proof’s website shows that the firm has invested in dozens of crypto startups, including the Apto blockchain development team Aptos Labs, cross-chain interoperability network Thorchain, and Lightspark – a company leveraging Bitcoin’s lightning network to enable fast, cheap, and global fiat currency transfers.\n\n➡️ The company is also responsible for setting up a staking platform on Celsius as part of the latter platform’s relaunch, bankruptcy filings show. Staking lets investors in certain cryptos generate yield by locking up their tokens to provide security for the networks that they trade on.\n\n➡️ Proof Group also includes leadership well-entrenched with crypto industry leaders.

Microsoft says this feature will be implemented “starting shortly.”\n\nIn the future, according to the blog post, Bing may even be able to reference previous sessions when interacting with users:👇\n\n“Over time, we’re exploring making your chats more personalized by bringing context from a previous chat into new conversations.”\n\n😌Perhaps the most ambitious addition announced is “Edge Actions,” also referred to as “Bing Actions,"" Microsoft’s term for upcoming integrations featuring third-party plug-ins for Bing chat.\n\nThe only plug-ins specifically mentioned in the announcement are OpenTable, which would allow users to reserve seats at restaurants directly within the chat interface, and Wolfram/Alpha, a modality that would allow users to create complex visualizations for math and science queries. Microsoft says more integrations will be revealed as they’re implemented.🌸",2023-05-04T20:50:00.000Z

It applied for judicial management the following week, which under Singaporean law, temporarily protected it against legal claims. “We are aiming to avoid a forced liquidation of our assets as it will require us to sell our users’ cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH and WBTC at these current depressed asset prices,” the company said at the time.\n\nAaron Loh Cheng Lee and another IJM are affiliated with EY Corporate Advisors.😎",2023-04-25T20:30:00.000Z

The vulnerability was related to BitGo Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) wallets and had the potential to expose the private keys of exchanges, banks, businesses and users of the platform.\n\nThe Fireblocks team named the vulnerability the BitGo Zero Proof Vulnerability, which would allow potential attackers to extract a private key in under a minute using a small amount of JavaScript code. BitGo suspended the vulnerable service on Dec. 10 and released a patch in February 2023 that required client-side updates to the latest version by March 17.\n\nThe Fireblocks team outlined how it identified the exploit using a free BitGo account on mainnet. A missing part of mandatory zero-knowledge proofs in BitGo’s ECDSA TSS wallet protocol allowed the team to expose the private key through a simple attack.🤟\n\nIndustry-standard enterprise-grade cryptocurrency asset platforms make use of either multiparty-computation (MPC/TSS) or multisignature technology to remove the possibility of a single point of attack. This is done by distributing a private key between multiple parties, to ensure security controls if one party is compromised.🤑\n\nFireblocks was able to prove that internal or external attackers could gain access to a full private key through two possible means.\n\n🤪A compromised client-side user could initiate a transaction to acquire a portion of the private key held in BitGo’s system. BitGo would then perform the signing computation before sharing information that leaks the BitGo key shard.\n\n“The attacker can now reconstruct the full private key, load it in an external wallet and withdraw the funds immediately or at a later stage.”",2023-03-17T20:00:02.000Z

He created Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash to take back financial control from institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. \n\n☝️The goal was crystal clear: create a trustless system of electronic transactions. The study of the Bitcoin whitepaper further shows that Bitcoin was designed to focus purely on financial transactions. \n\n🟡In fact, Nakamoto had previously opposed the addition of other use cases to the leading cryptocurrency. In 2011, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin rejected the idea of integrating a domain name system (DNS) into Bitcoin called BitDNS, saying that combining all proof-of-work consensus systems into one dataset would not be scalable. \n\n👨‍💼""The primary goal behind the creation of Bitcoin was to serve as a medium of value transfer,"" Sebastian Jan Menge, co-founder of FitBurn, said in a comment. However, this goal has evolved many times over the past decade. \n\n🧈The first Crypto enthusiasts mostly bought in on the idea that Bitcoin's canonical hard cap of 21 million coins would make it a hedge against inflation. This led to the cryptocurrency gaining some reputation as ""digital gold,"" or a sound store of value. \n\n📉Even Goldman Sachs put forward the “store of value” thesis for Bitcoin.

The firm blamed the regulatory crackdown for the increased outflows.\n\n“We believe😊 this is due to ETP investors being less optimistic on recent regulatory pressures in the US relative to the broader market.”\n\nHowever, negative sentiment from institutional investors was not mirrored by the broader markets which saw a 10% gain for the period. This pushed total assets under management for institutional products to $30 million, the highest level since August 2022, noted Butterfill.\n\nThere were also outflows for Ethereum and mixed-asset funds but blockchain equities bucked the trend with inflows totaling $9.6 million for the week.\n\nInstitutions started pouring capital back into crypto funds in January with inflows for the last week of the month totaling $117 million, reaching a six-month high.\n\nHowever, funds have seen outflows for the past fortnight following four weeks of inflows in January.",2023-02-21T17:01:00.000Z

But most of today’s policymakers seem intent on killing the high-integrity innovators.”\n\nThe Custodia Bank CEO claimed that her efforts to work with government agencies were ultimately thrown back in her face as she recounted the spate of negative run-ins her firm has had of late. \n\n“Custodia was simultaneously attacked by the White House, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the Kansas City Fed and Senator Dick Durbin (who conflated our non-leveraged, 100-percent liquid and solvent bank with FTX in a Senate floor speech),” she said, adding that:\n\n“Custodia tried to become federally regulated – the very result bipartisan policymakers claim to want. Yet Custodia has been denied and now disparaged for daring to come through the front door.”\n\nHer sentiments echo that of figures such as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who has suggested on multiple occasions that agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have reacted frostily to his firm’s efforts to maintain a dialogue in good faith.",2023-02-18T17:00:14.000Z

In addition, the report also highlighted that despite warnings from financial authorities, Shin has reportedly given money to other companies like Tmon to promote LUNC as a safe payment method.\n\nOn Nov. 14, prosecutors in South Korea called on Shin to cooperate with the investigation of the Terra collapse.

NEO/USD was last changing hands slightly to the north of $9.0 per token, up around 47% year-to-date, though the cryptocurrency has now pulled over 10% lower versus its Thursday highs in the $10.40 area. \n\nNEO’s gains really got going around this time last month when the cryptocurrency broke to the north of a downtrend that had been in play going all the way back to March 2022. NEO then proceeded to break above all of its major moving averages, including, most importantly, its 200-Day Moving Average at the start of February. The 21DMA has been acting as a strong area of support in recent weeks, and NEO appears to be in an aggressive uptrend date back to the end of 2022. \n\nShould the current uptrend continue, NEO could soon test long-term support/resistance in the $12.50-$13.50 area. Conversely, should the current uptrend snap, then NEO would receive strong support in the mid-$8.0s from the 21 and 200DMAs, plus an area of resistance-turned-support.\n\nNEO has been rallying in tandem with a broader move higher in cryptocurrencies since the start of the year, with traders betting that 2023 will be a better year amid signs that 1) major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin might have bottomed and 2) that the US Federal Reserve will substantially slow the pace of interest rate rises. The return in risk appetite has disproportionately benefitted altcoins like NEO and if the rally continues, NEO could well see easy 40% gains from current levels.\n\nBut in a cryptocurrency bull market, investors may be able to secure even more impressive gains, perhaps in the region of 10x, if they invest in the right crypto presales.

He added that the first test transactions of the tokenization platform are likely to take place this year.\n\nDekaBank’s upcoming blockchain platform is developed in collaboration with the digital asset management system Metaco Harmonize. The bank officially announced a partnership with Metaco on Jan. 31, planning to deploy Harmonize as the core platform for an “institutional digital asset offering.”\n\nAccording to Sack, the upcoming offering will involve tokenizing assets like bonds, stocks and funds in order to enable a new token economy. “Metaco is the key to this economy because it is our key management solution for tokenized assets on different blockchains,” he said.\n\nThe exec noted that plenty of blockchains are used for tokenization, including the Ethereum and Polygon networks. “It is not yet clear if there is one blockchain that will become the standard,” he added.\n\nSack emphasized that DekaBank is not planning to offer trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as part of its partnership with Metaco. That is because DekaBank is focused on regulated products, according to the German Electronic Securities Act, he said, adding:\n\n“Cryptocurrencies are tradable around the world, more regulated in some parts of the world, and less to not regulated in other parts of the world. The implications that can arise due to these disparities are potentially very large and can carry very high risks.”",2023-02-09T17:01:00.000Z

This means that the Boba Network will be the sixth chain to deploy Uniswap v3, with the deployment scheduled to proceed in the coming weeks. The move was backed by several entities such as GFX Labs, Blockchain at Michigan, Gauntlet and ConsenSys.\n\nAccording to Alan Chiu, the co-founder and CEO of Enya Labs, a core contributor to Boba Network, the move will enable developers within the ecosystem to create a new generation of on and off-chain decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on top of Uniswap. Chiu explained that:\n\n“While the Uniswap protocol will remain permissionless, developers will be able to build a compliant layer atop of it that leverages Hybrid Compute to tap existing, TradFi-friendly KYC/AML services.”\n\nAs a result of this, Chiu noted that the decentralized exchange will be more accessible to the broader institutional market. In addition, the Boba Network team also believes that this opens an opportunity for Uniswap to expand into the key Asian markets, highlighting that Boba Network gained a lot of traction in South Korea and is slowly expanding to Japan.\n\nMeanwhile, in a recent fireside chat, Aave founder Stani Kulechov spoke with Cointelegraph’s managing editor Alex Cohen to discuss DeFi adoption.

The shift to the EV ecosystem is now evident in SUVs, sedans, trucks, minivans, and sports cars. \n\nOne of the key benefits of electric vehicles is their affordability. Drivers can now purchase their preferred EV cars and eliminate the need to buy gas, which is especially important given the disruptions in energy supplies and rising gas prices. Other advantages of EVs include their low maintenance cost compared to other gas-powered competitors, fast acceleration, smooth ride, and positive environmental impact, making them appealing.  \n\nAs the issue of climate change continues to be raised, the adoption of electric vehicles is poised to play an integral role in reducing carbon emissions dangerous to humans and the world. With the growing awareness of environmental benefits and driving convenience, electric vehicles quickly gain trust and popularity among drivers.  \n\nAs EV vehicles are produced, charging infrastructures and payment methods are yet to catch up, which is a major setback in the EV ecosystem. Users can’t easily access charging stations or tell which ones are functioning, how much the charge will cost, and a payment method – these are significant and becoming a major concern for potential EV owners. This is where EV solutions like C+Charge come in. \n\nC+Charge is an innovative decentralized platform that aims to build a robust peer-to-peer (P2P) payment system for electric vehicles (EV) charging stations built on sophisticated blockchain technology. \n\nThe EV-charging payment solution is powered by a versatile app that connects EV owners with several functional charging networks. This makes it easy for users to locate and schedule charging times. Users are also provided electronic wallets, which they can use to pay for EV charging costs with the platform’s utility token, SCCHG, within the app. \n\nThe C+Charge application also offers real-time tracking of available charging stations, transparent pricing, and trip planning and mitigates additional costs for EV owners and stations.",2023-02-03T17:01:23.000Z

The case will also be against co-founder Greg Solano, billionaire BAYC founder Kerem Atalay, Yuga Labs CEO Nicole Muniz, as well as some world-known celebrities, including Madonna and firms such as Adidas and MoonPay.\n\nThe new lawsuit is yet another attempt to hold Yuga Labs accountable for massive losses by NFT investors who bought BAYC and APE over the past few years. By October 2022, the average transaction value of BAYC NFTs had plummeted below $85,000 after reaching $312,000 in April 2022. The floor price of BAYC NFTs also tumbled from around 144 Ether, or $226,000, to 64 ETH ($100,000) at the time of writing.\n\nYuga Labs also faced a similar lawsuit from American plaintiffs Adonis Real and Adam Titcher in December 2022. Similarly to Rosen’s class action, the complaint listed more than 40 people and companies as defendants, including Madonna, Justin Bieber, Paris Hilton, Snoop Dogg, Jimmy Fallon, Post Malone and others.\n\nPreviously, law firm Scott+Scott filed a class-action suit against Yuga Labs in June 2022, arguing that the firm “inappropriately induced” the community to buy BAYC NFTs and ApeCoin.",2023-01-31T17:02:00.000Z

The administration’s legislative guidance addressed much of the document to the U.S. Congress.\n\nThe authors of the statement outlined a two-pronged path forward. They wrote:\n\n“We have spent the past year identifying the risks of cryptocurrencies and acting to mitigate them using the authorities that the Executive Branch has.”\n\nThe first element in the road map is the administration’s “first-ever” comprehensive framework for digital asset development, released in September 2022. That document was based on reports mandated by the president’s executive order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets issued in March 2022.\n\nSecond, executive agencies are increasing enforcement and issuing new guidance. According to the statement, government agencies are developing public awareness programs “to help consumers understand the risks of buying cryptocurrencies.” It mentioned banking regulators in particular and encouraged them to continue their efforts.

Its recommendations include expanding regulators’ powers, strengthening disclosure requirements, strengthening penalties for misconduct, increasing funding for law enforcement and following the advice found in the Financial Stability Oversight Council report mandated by the executive order.\n\nThe authors also took the opportunity to urge Congress not to do things too:\n\n“Legislation should not greenlight mainstream institutions, like pension funds, to dive headlong into cryptocurrency markets.”",2023-01-28T17:00:08.000Z
