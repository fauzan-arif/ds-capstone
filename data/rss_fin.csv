In comparison, when Americans were at their peak indebtedness right before the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, they were utilizing 13.2% of their income to service their debts.</p><p>To determine how Canadian mortgage holders are responding to higher interest rates, <a href=""https://economics.td.com/ca-mortgage-reset-puzzle"" target=""_blank"">TD Economics analyzed</a> anonymous internal mortgage and credit card data to assess how spending patterns have changed.</p><p>""High household debt is the biggest vulnerability of the Canadian economy,"" the report from James Orlando, TD’s Director of Economics, reads. ""As more homeowners reset their mortgages at higher rates, less disposable income is available to maintain consumer spending.""</p><p>Based on TD’s data, mortgage holders have pulled back their spending by approximately 1% compared to those without a mortgage. This has resulted in a $6B reduction in spending across the economy. In the absence of higher mortgage rates, TD said growth in real consumer spending would have come in at approximately 1.9% year over year in Q3.

Those who renewed in 2023 have made the most significant cuts, having reduced their spending by 2.4% annually. In comparison, Canadians without a mortgage have increased their spending by 1%.</p><p>Meanwhile, mortgage holders who are facing renewal in 2024 have pulled back their spending by just 0.5% annually, which TD notes is likely a ""precaution,"" as they await a potentially sizeable payment shock.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"">\n<img alt="""" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""a5db5"" src=""https://storeys.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=50758486&amp;width=980"" />\n</p><p><a href=""https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2023/05/financial-system-review-2023/#chart12"" target=""_blank"">According to the Bank of Canada</a>, 47% of all mortgages will have renewed at a higher rate by the end of 2023.

Some economists are warning that monetary policy will continue to lean hawkish moving forward, and that it’s too soon for the bank to say anything concrete about rate cuts. </p><p>Derek Holt, Vice President and Head of Capital Markets Economics at Scotiabank, says there’s “a low, but non-zero probability” that the BoC will opt for a hike on Wednesday. </p><p>He writes in a <a href=""https://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/about/economics/economics-publications/post.other-publications.global-week-ahead.december-1--2023.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">note</a> from Friday that a hike would “shock markets,” but the bank may not be discouraged by that if they feel it’s “the right thing to do.”</p><p>“The BoC does have a tendency to surprise markets as we’ve seen several times during the cycle. It’s an aloof organization that couldn’t care less if traders wind up drowning their sorrows at the local watering hole,” says Holt.</p><p>However, he adds that Governor Tiff Macklem may not have the wherewithal to hike given the latest <a href=""https://storeys.com/canada-inflation-october-2023/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_self"">inflation reading</a>, which came down to 3.1% year over year in October. </p><p>“[Macklem] recently guided that the policy rate might be restrictive enough, but they were not sure and were prepared to tighten again if needed.”</p><p>Wednesday’s rate decision will be followed by a speech from Governing Council on Thursday, it’s worth noting. Holt anticipates that Thursday’s speech will be the more “insightful” of the two events, and could be revealing of the bank’s “hawkish bias.”</p><p>“For one thing, the bond market — and hence the mortgage market — has got to be catching their attention again,” he says. </p><p>“Mortgage rate cuts are back in vogue now and thanks to the fact that a key driver of fixed-term mortgage rate pricing — the five-year GoC yield — is down by almost a percentage point from the peak and back to levels unseen since early last June.</p><p>“The BoC needs to be very careful to avoid doing anything this week that would drive 5s richer yet. We could wind up plumbing the sub-3% depths into the winter mortgage pre-approvals and spring housing markets and unleash greater inflationary pressures through another powerful housing boom with spillover effects on related consumption.”</p><p>Last week also brought new GDP and labour market data, which will certainly play into the tone of the Bank’s deliberations, according to a <a href=""https://economics.td.com/ca-weekly-bottom-line"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">report</a> from TD Economist Marc Ercolao. </p><p>Ercolao says that although the Canadian economy is “showing weakness” — GDP contracted by an annualized 1.1% in the third quarter — the country has thus far managed to stave off a technical recession. On the employment side, he notes that recent <a href=""https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/231201/dq231201a-eng.htm"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">data</a> from Statistics Canada shows that employment growth slowing, “but hasn't fully ceded its strength.”</p><p>“Developments this week support our forecast that the BoC is done with rate hikes. However, it is too early for the BoC to lean too dovish at next week's meeting and say anything about rate cuts or their timing,” Ercolao writes. “The Bank will likely need to see inflation, especially core measures, move durably lower before they move off their bias towards rate hikes.”</p><p>Nonetheless, there is evidence that the Canadian economy is slowing and on track to soften further, RBC economists Nathan Janzen and Claire Fan explain in a recent <a href=""https://thoughtleadership.rbc.com/forward-guidance-our-weekly-preview/"" target=""_blank"">note</a>. </p><p>“The BoC will remain mindful of inflationary risks and retain the option to move interest rate higher. But we don’t see that as likely to be necessary,” they write. “Focus has shifted from whether additional interest rate hikes will be needed to how long before the first cuts.”</p><p>In contrast to both Holt and Ercolao, Janzen and Fan anticipate a “dovish lean” from the BoC on Wednesday (relative to past interest rate decisions). Even so, they say they don’t believe the bank will be in any ‘rush’ to cut rates. </p><p>“Lower inflation prints over the late fall were welcome but followed a string of ‘sticky’ core inflation readings. We expect the BoC will stay on hold through the first half of 2024 before moving to rate cuts in Q3 next year.”</p>","Mon, 04 Dec 2023 18:16:27 +0000"

Instead, the report says consumers are ‘parking’ money in their bank accounts, with around $175B placed in term deposits at chartered banks over the past year, marking an increase of roughly 40%.</p><p>Royce Mendes, Managing Director and Head of Macro Strategy for Desjardins, writes that “it’s not hard to believe that Canadians with looming mortgage renewals are getting their financial houses in order before the coming storm.”</p><p>Mendes adds that rate resets will be a “significant drain” on household finances in the coming years.</p><p>“Should markets be right about the path for interest rates, the worst-off borrowers could see upwards of 70% increases in their monthly mortgage payments,” he warns. </p><p>While some borrowers will look to extend the amortizations of their mortgages, others will opt to make lump-sum payments to “soften the blow,” Mendes explains. </p><p>“These options, however, come with their own costs,” he continues. </p><p>“Making significant adjustments to the amortization schedule of a mortgage can materially alter the long-term financial trajectory of a household. Extending the length of time a borrower takes to pay off debt could add hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional interest payments and would leave the borrower at the mercy of the ups and downs in interest rates for even longer.”</p><p>Meanwhile, lump-sum payments represent “a prudent way to de-risk a household’s balance sheet,” Mendes says. </p><p>“But the numbers are huge. A homeowner who made a 20% downpayment and borrowed the rest to purchase an average-priced house in Toronto during the pandemic would need to come up with between $80K and $200K to keep their monthly mortgage payment the same when it comes up for renewal.”</p><p>Mendes also speaks to the Bank of Canada’s (presumed) next moves in Friday's report, saying that “Canadian central bankers have every reason to hold rates unchanged” at their upcoming meeting, slated for Wednesday, December 6. </p><p>“The economy is slowing, labour market tightness is easing, and inflation is cooling. The question is to what extent will they acknowledge these positive developments,” he writes. </p><p>“Policymakers want to guard against false dawns. As a result, we expect them to retain language indicating that officials are still ready to raise rates if necessary. For our part, we don’t see them making good on that threat. We expect the BoC is done raising rates for this cycle and will turn to rate cuts in the second quarter of 2024.”</p>","Fri, 01 Dec 2023 21:28:29 +0000"

The charter “builds on the government’s existing guidance and expectations for how financial institutions are to work with Canadians to provide tailored relief and ensure payments are reasonable for borrowers,” according to the Department of Finance.</p><p>More specifically, the feds say that Canadian homeowners can now expect the following: </p><ul><li>Temporary extensions of the amortization period for mortgage holders at risk;</li><li>waived fees and costs that would have otherwise been charged for relief measures;</li><li>not having to requalify under the insured minimum qualifying rate when switching lenders at mortgage renewal (for insured mortgage holders);</li><li>to be contacted four to six months in advance of their mortgage renewal to inform them of their renewal options;</li><li>the ability to make lump sum payments to avoid negative amortization or sell their principal residence without any prepayment penalties; </li><li>and no interest on interest in the event that mortgage relief measures result in a temporary period of negative amortization.</li></ul><p>“Our goal is to help Canadians through an incredibly challenging time by making sure Canadians have the support they need to afford their homes when renewing at a time of higher interest rates,” Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday.</p><p>The charter has, generally speaking, been well-received by industry stakeholders. At the same time, <a href=""https://storeys.com/housing-industry-fall-economic-statement/"" target=""_self"">experts say</a> that the outlined measures don’t go quite far enough. </p><p>“It's a step in the right direction to protect Canadian mortgage holders, however, I think additional substantive measures are needed, particularly when we're thinking about folks that have mortgage renewals coming up over the next number of years,” Cecely Roy, Director of Communications for <a href=""https://mortgageproscan.ca/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Mortgage Professionals Canada</a>, tells STOREYS. </p><p>“We know that we've got a wave of renewals on the horizon. About 19% of the folks we surveyed over the summer are expecting to renew over the next year. And then that jumps all the way up to 65% in the next three years.”</p><p>Roy points out that, with the exception of the requirement for lenders to reach out to their borrowers four to six months in advance of their renewal date, “there isn’t a lot of new content” in the charter. </p><p>“The FCAC guideline that was released over the summer in response to exceptional circumstances for mortgage holders and the OSFI regulations for federally regulated financial institutions already had many of these pieces in place,” she says. </p><p>“And then the piece that says insured mortgages don't need to be stress tested again at renewal, switch, or transfer — well, that was already always the case, though it wasn't commonly known... I don't want to detract from the fact that it's important that the government recognizes there is significant pressure on folks with mortgages, but they're not going far enough to protect Canadian homeowners.”</p><p>Roy also notes that a more effective measure from the feds could be returning to a 30-year amortization period for insured mortgages. </p><p>“And that really would provide more opportunities for homeownership, especially for those folks that are looking to enter into the market. Because not only are we concerned about existing mortgage holders, but also prospective first-time buyers who want to get into the market,” she says. </p><p>“Of course, it's important to increase housing supply, as the government is focussing on, but I think we really need to see more tangible steps to support the growing number of middle-class Canadians who can’t afford to own a home.”</p>","Fri, 24 Nov 2023 19:43:30 +0000"

Macklem acknowledged this, saying the BoC knows that ""the higher interest rates that are working to bring inflation down are making things difficult for many Canadians."" However, the alternative — ""years and years of high inflation and then a deep recession,"" Macklem said — would be ""much worse.""</p><p> By  making borrowing more expensive, and thus more out of reach for Canadians, the bank has been able to drive down demand and, in turn, prices. Recent inflation data from Statistics Canada found that inflation dropped to 3.1% in October, much closer to the BoC's target of 2% than the 8.1% inflation rate seen in June of last year.</p><p>Many experts have predicted that falling inflation may be enough to spur rate cuts at some point next year. Macklem said that the bank may be able to cut interest rates before inflation falls to 2%, but simultaneously warned that if high inflation persists, the bank is prepared to raise its policy rate even further. In fact, during a question and answer period following his speech on Wednesday, Macklem said ""it is not time to start thinking about cutting interest rates.""</p><p>""It ticked down yesterday but one month is not a trend,"" Macklem said. ""We need to see a number of months to see clear evidence that we're on a path to 2% inflation. When we see clear evidence, [...] that will be a time to start thinking about cutting interest rates.""</p><p>Macklem's speech comes as more focus is being placed on the riskiness of homeowners having to renew in a high-interest-rate environment. A recent <a href=""https://storeys.com/canadian-mortgages-renewal-2026/"" target=""_blank"">RBC Capital Markets report</a> notes that 60% of mortgages are set to renew in the next three years, with many of those in store for a ""payment shock"" as interest rates are not only up significantly from the historic low of 0.25% seen during the pandemic, but from the sub-2% rates seen in the years immediately before the pandemic.</p><p>The federal government drew more attention to the issue on Tuesday <a href=""https://storeys.com/canada-announces-billions-housing-construction/"" target=""_blank"">in its fall economic statement</a>, outlining a new mortgage charter that dictates how lenders will deal with at-risk borrowers. The six-point plan, dubbed The Canadian Mortgage Charter, mandates that lenders contact homeowners four to six months before they are set to renew their mortgage to review their options, as well as allow temporary extensions of the amortization period for mortgage holders who are at risk.</p><p>Fees and costs that would have otherwise been charged for relief measures will be waived, and at-risk homeowners must be given the ability to make lump sum payments to avoid negative amortization or to sell their principal residence without any prepayment penalties. Additionally, interest cannot be charged on interest in the event that mortgage relief measures result in a temporary period of negative amortization.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, for borrowers with an insured mortgage who are looking to switch lenders when it comes time to renew, a stress test will no longer be required — a likely relief to many borrowers who would likely no longer qualify for their mortgages had they had to pass a stress test.</p><p>In his speech, Macklem acknowledged that inflation is harshly, and disproportionally, affecting lower-income Canadians.</p><p>""People are working hard, but their salaries don’t buy what they used to,"" he said. ""They can’t afford the things they need to live. It feels unfair and that feeling of unfairness eats away at the fabric of society.”</p>","Thu, 23 Nov 2023 21:51:42 +0000"

Higher interest rates would normally exert downward pressure on house prices and other costs that are closely linked to house prices, such as maintenance, taxes, and insurance. </p><p>“However, the ongoing structural shortage of housing supply in the economy was sustaining elevated house prices. And the rapid increase in Canada’s population had added to the existing imbalance between demand and supply for housing.”</p><p>In combination with “near-term inflation expectations” and “elevated” wage growth, housing realities contributed to the “persistence in inflation,” the Bank explains. </p><p>“As a result, Governing Council members revised up their forecast for inflation in the near term. But with a weaker growth outlook and more excess supply, they continued to expect inflation would return to the 2% target in 2025.”</p><h3>Council Split On October Rate Hold</h3><p>As we now know, the BoC opted to hold its benchmark rate steady at 5% in September, and then again in October. That said, it seems that Council was split with respect to October’s decision in particular. </p><p>“Some members felt that it was more likely than not that the policy rate would need to increase further to return inflation to target. Others viewed the most likely scenario as one where a 5% policy rate would be sufficient to get inflation back to the 2% target, provided it was maintained at that level for long enough,” says the summary.</p><p>“However, there was a strong consensus that, with clearer evidence of higher interest rates moderating spending, slowing growth, and relieving price pressures, Governing Council should be patient and hold the policy rate at 5%. They agreed to revisit the need for a higher policy rate at future decisions with the benefit of more information.”</p><p>In other words — and contrary to beliefs <a href=""https://storeys.com/canada-inflation-interest-rates-october-2023/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_self"">recently voiced </a>by a number of economists — another rate hike is still very much so on the table. </p><p>“Given the slower-than-expected progress toward price stability and increased inflationary risks, members agreed to state clearly that they were prepared to raise the policy rate further if needed,” says the Bank. </p><h3>Rate Cut Expected By April 2024</h3><p>Another rate hike may loom, it seems, but according to the BoC’s third-quarter <a href=""https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2023/11/markets-participants-survey-third-quarter-of-2023/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Market Participants Survey</a> — informed by the sentiments of close to 30 financial market participants — rate cuts are also on the horizon.</p><p>The survey, which came out on Monday, reveals that many participants anticipate that the Bank will opt to cut rates as soon as April 2024. </p><p>As well, participants say they expect the Bank to cut rates by a full basis point in 2024, which would bring the overnight target rate back down to 4%. By 2025, according to the survey results, the benchmark rate is expected to come down further to 3%. </p>","Fri, 10 Nov 2023 16:43:48 +0000"

Brown says that borrowers are increasingly turning to non-bank lenders (think: a credit union or mortgage investment entity), pointing to Statistics Canada’s data on non-bank mortgage lending, which dates back to 2020.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"">\n<img alt=""non bank lenders forced home sales"" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""4ae12"" src=""https://storeys.com/media-library/non-bank-lenders-forced-home-sales.png?id=50415245&amp;width=980"" />\n</p><p>“On the face of it, the recent release for the second quarter does not show much cause for alarm.

They have benefitted from five years of cumulative house price gains, totalling 40%, and face a smaller rate increase than those that took out a mortgage during the pandemic,” he says. </p><p>Brown also warns that the coming months will see an increase in the number of insured mortgage holders struggling to refinance. </p><p>“While non-bank lenders stepped in to help these borrowers earlier this year, they may be less inclined to do so now that falling house prices are further eroding borrowers’ equity and the economy has entered recession,” he says.</p><p>“The upshot is that the risk of forced home sales is rising. The tentative signs of a stabilization in new listings in the October <a href=""https://storeys.com/gta-home-sales-prices-october/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_self"">local real estate board data</a> provide some comfort, but there are clear downside risks to our forecast that house prices will fall by only 5% over the next six months.”</p>","Tue, 07 Nov 2023 19:54:42 +0000"

While that figure on its own may not seem remarkably high, Guatieri notes that it represents a “record share” of disposable income.</p><p>“While affordability is also at multi-decade lows in the US, less-indebted American households (many with still-low fixed mortgage payments) are spending a near-record-low share of income (4%) servicing their mortgage,” writes Guatieri. </p><p>“For Canada to have a reasonable chance of closing a widening chasm in living standards with the US, [besides] filling a deep productivity hole, it will need to build a lot more houses at a cost that most people can comfortably afford.”</p><p>Whether or not this is a realistic expectation is another matter entirely, particularly considering Canada’s “explosive population growth,” Guatieri continues. </p><p>“Meeting the supply challenge could prove intractable given a shortage of construction workers, though government policies to lower developer costs are starting to gain traction. The hope is that supply will increase before interest rates fall materially and spark another upturn in demand, which, in a supply-constrained market, would only feed higher prices and strangle affordability.”</p><p>Monday's note also includes some high-level forecasting, and warns that Canadian home sales, which have been down for the past three months, “are likely to stay down in the first half of next year.”</p><p>Meanwhile, home prices, which are down 10% from the early 2022 peak, could “sag” an additional 6% before the market “finds a footing,” Guatieri also says. </p><p>“Strength in a few regions, notably Alberta amid decent affordability and strong population inflows, won’t offset weakness in more expensive places such as Toronto, Vancouver, and much of Southern Ontario.”</p><p>While Guatieri says that the Canadian housing market would be “even colder” if not for healthy job and population growth, his overarching message is that the market is downcast and on track to stay that way well into the new year. </p><p>“Demand will stay depressed until the Bank of Canada cuts rates, possibly next summer. Don't expect a repeat of the spring fling,” he writes. </p>","Tue, 07 Nov 2023 16:19:27 +0000"

Likewise, kudos to the Government of Ontario for their swift commitment to do the same. Cue the City of Toronto and other cities to provide relief and instead, we get potential or enacted property tax increases.</p><p>As most people can accurately discern, tenants in our province pay property taxes through their rent. This is why Ontario’s Residential Tenancies Act appropriately mandates a rent reduction to pass through year-over-year decreases of more than 2.49% and allows rental owners to apply for an Above Guideline Increase for yearly tax bills that grow by more than the same amount.</p><p>While we know that some politicians in the GTA are ‘ready to tax,’ true progressives should be having a conversation about <em>who</em> should be paying these taxes. To highlight the current tax unfairness, let’s look at the City of Toronto which currently taxes residential property at a rate of 0.506% of its value. Ownership housing — detached, semi-detached, town and stacked townhomes, as well was condominiums — are all captured in the RT tax class. Multi-residential properties are in a separate (MT) class and are taxed almost double the residential rate at 0.967%. There is a new multi-residential rate which a 2017 law forbids from exceeding residential rates, but as the name suggests, this only applies to new builds. </p><p>With nearly half of Toronto’s population living in purpose-built rental housing, the overwhelming majority of tenants as a group are then subsidizing the living costs of Toronto’s homeowners. And as a renter, I find this government-imposed economic inequity deeply frustrating.</p><p>If ‘growth pays for growth,’ users should pay for use.</p><p>It’s high time we re-balance the property tax burden so that those who are lucky enough to own their own home (from which tax-free capital gains accrue) proportionately fund our municipal services. Municipalities should charge people who do not own their homes no more than half what they expect homeowners to hand over. This is progressive policy that would protect the middle class and those seeking to join it. Federal and provincial governments would do well to incent these types of policies. Federal Housing Minister Sean Fraser has been effective in using the accelerator fund carrot and not a stick in bringing municipalities to the table on the issue of missing middle supply and outdated zoning.</p><p>This is a highly regulated industry, but unlike others, there seems to be an inverse risk-to-reward relationship when it comes to investing in purpose-built rentals. Going forward if rental price stabilization is what we want, the costs of operating rental stock should be just as stable.</p>","Wed, 01 Nov 2023 10:00:06 +0000"

And we're very conscious of the impact that high interest rates are having on Canadians,” said Bowers, who <a href=""https://storeys.com/cmhc-romy-bowers-stepping-down/"" target=""_blank"">confirmed over the weekend</a> that she will be stepping down from her role with CMHC at the end of this year.</p><p>On the crown corporation’s books, there are presently around 6,000 households with “highest risk mortgages” given today’s interest rate realities, translating to about 2% of all mortgages insured by CMHC. </p><p>While Bowers said that those 6,000-some households are at the “greatest exposure of loss,” she also said that she doesn’t believe the country is in for a wave of mortgage defaults. However, a “large spike in unemployment” could change that, she added. </p><p>“Our arrears are at historic lows. And as long as the employment picture is strong, we do not anticipate defaults.”</p><p>Bowers additionally stated that the number of Canadian mortgages in arrears is now at 0.25%. (That figure is down from 0.5% in December 2022.)</p><p>“It's very low, partly because house prices continue to increase in some markets, people have more equity, and the employment picture for homeowners at least is very strong,” Bowers explained. </p><p>Despite the fact that mortgage arrears are reportedly down, it’s certainly worth noting that many borrowers are tapping into longer mortgage amortization periods — an option that is now being offered quite commonly by lenders, so long as the initial downpayment has been made — which is helping to keep heads above water. </p><p>RBC said in its third-quarter report to shareholders that 43% of its residential mortgages now have amortization periods exceeding 25 years. Meanwhile, Toronto-Dominion (TD) Bank’s third-quarter report showed that 48% of its mortgages now have amortization periods greater than 25 years. </p><p>Both RBC and TD have reported a spike in amortizations being extended to more than 35 years.

65802581c7b44d3dfb1c5142,STOREYS,Income Growth Is No Match For Climbing Mortgage Costs In Canadian Cities,"<img src=""https://storeys.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=50314571&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"" /><br /><br /><p>Sky-high mortgage rates are the topic of conversations at both dinner tables and boardrooms across the country as of late. From coast to coast, Canada’s home prices have been on a consistent upward climb since 2013 – with this rate rapidly accelerating during the pandemic. Simultaneously, borrowers enjoyed moderately steady interest rates until 2021, when they plummeted to the lowest in Canadian history.<br /></p><p>Not that anyone needs the reminder, but we all know what happened next. </p><p>In the past year and a half, Canada’s <a href=""https://storeys.com/boc-interest-rate-timeline-home-sales/"" target=""_blank"">perpetually climbing interest rates</a> spiked to a 15-year high. Now, countless Canadian families have altered their monthly budgets to account for higher monthly mortgage payments. While interest rates have increased, income growth has struggled to keep pace, something that’s driving would-be homebuyers to step away from the real estate market for the time being. </p><p>To find out how quickly the cost of mortgages has grown compared to income, <a href=""https://www.zoocasa.com/blog/mortgage-payment-growth-vs-income-2013-2023"" target=""_blank"">Zoocasa</a> analyzed home prices from September 2013 to September 2023 in 17 Canadian cities and calculated what the average mortgage payment would be for each year on an average-priced home. These calculations assumed the minimum possible down payment and an amortization period of 25 years, and used the five-year fixed rate in September of each year analyzed. </p><p>Researchers then compared this to the average annual income according to Statistics Canada in each city to see how the rates of growth differ. The five-year fixed mortgage rates were sourced from <a href=""https://www.ratehub.ca/5-year-fixed-mortgage-rate-history"" target=""_blank"">Ratehub.com</a> and were as follows: 3.29% in September 2013; 2.72% in September 2014; 2.34% in September 2015; 2.17% in September 2016; 2.64% in September 2017; 3.09% in September 2018; 2.37% in September 2019; and 1.64% in both September 2020 and September 2021. </p><p>In September 2022, the rate surged to 4.34%. That brings us to September 2023, when the five-year fixed rate was at a peak of 5.49%. Gulp. </p><p>While mortgage payments climbed across the country, some cities saw them soar more than others – especially with respect to their income increases. Over the past decade, average monthly mortgage payments increased in every city analyzed, with the majority of cities’ mortgage payments increasing by more than $1,000 and four cities increasing by more than $3,000 since 2013. </p><p>While cities in Ontario and British Columbia benefitted from considerable increases in average income, monthly mortgage payments in both notoriously pricey provinces were up drastically. The rapidly growing Hamilton-Burlington and Barrie District both saw the largest mortgage increases, according to Zoocasa data. </p><p>Back in 2013, the average monthly mortgage payment in Hamilton-Burlington was just a dreamy $1,680. By 2023, it had risen to $5,034 – a dramatic increase of $3,354. Barrie experienced a similar story, with the average monthly mortgage payment rising from $1,442 in 2013 to $4,778 in 2023. At the same time, the average price for a home in Hamilton-Burlington and Barrie District increased by more than $500,000 between 2013 and 2023, largely driving this increase in monthly mortgage payments.</p><p>In the same time period, wages increased in both cities by an average of $6,300, or 12.8%. Even those who don’t excel on the math front can see that’s no match for the near or over 200% rate of increase for mortgage payments in each city. </p><p>Following Hamilton and Barrie, Victoria and Greater Toronto were the next cities to see mortgage payments increase by more than $3000 – an increase of 158% for Victoria and 129.8% for Toronto. While income in both cities was up by more than $7,000, this equates to just a 15.2% increase for Victoria and a 16% increase for Toronto. </p><p>In some cities, relatively affordable home prices kept mortgage costs down – you just need to embrace a bitter-cold winter as a trade-off. The only three cities that experienced less than a 50% increase in mortgage payments were Saskatoon (45.2%), Edmonton (39.4%), and Regina (29.4%). These were also the only cities where home prices increased by less than $60,000, with Regina home prices only increasing by $10,600 from 2013. This meant that Regina residents saw their monthly mortgage payments inch up by just $422 in the last ten years. With that said, wages in Regina actually fell, with the average income in 2013 at $52,800 and in 2021, the last time data was available, declined to $52,100. </p><p>Regina wasn’t the only city to see a drop in wages. Wages also fell in Edmonton and Saskatoon, though just by $100 in Edmonton and $700 in Saskatoon. Meanwhile. Calgary’s average income dropped from $65,800 in 2013 to $61,400 in 2021. Compared to other metropolitan cities, home prices and monthly mortgage payments grew moderately less in the Alberta city. Monthly mortgage payments in Calgary increased by $1,350 to $3,317 in September 2023 – the highest average monthly mortgage payment outside of Ontario and British Columbia. </p><p>Over in Saint John – largely celebrated as one of the most affordable cities in Canada – home prices increased by $124,000 between 2013 and 2023 and monthly mortgage payments increased by nearly $1,000.

In a <a href=""https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2023/10/fad-press-release-2023-10-25/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">statement</a>, the bank cited “growing evidence that past interest rate increases are dampening economic activity,” including with respect to housing, where demand has softened considerably. </p><p>Even so, in <a href=""https://www.bankofcanada.ca/multimedia/press-conference-monetary-policy-report-october-2023/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">addressing the media</a> following yesterday’s rate announcement, BoC Governor Tiff Macklem and Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers expressed that home prices have not responded to rate hikes in the anticipated or desired way. </p><p>“Normally, house prices move pretty lockstep with interest rate increases. Most Canadians buy houses with credit, so they're one of the first things that respond to monetary policy,” said Rogers. </p><p>And while prices have indeed come down <a href=""https://storeys.com/boc-interest-rate-timeline-home-sales/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_self"">over the course of the hike cycle</a> — the not-seasonally-adjusted, national average price has slipped from $796,000 in March 2022 to $655,507 last month — many month-over-month declines have been nominal. There were also a number of months where prices managed to rally and offset declines.</p><p>“Relative to the degree of rate increases, we're not seeing the decline in house prices that we would expect,” continued Rogers.</p><p>“There is a structural lack of supply in the Canadian housing market. So, really, until we address that supply issue, interest rates on their own are not going to help us get back to a housing affordability situation.”</p><p>BoC staff also spoke to mortgage realities confronting Canadians on Wednesday, saying that the bank is “paying really close attention to the mortgage renewal cycle.”</p><p>“Basically it’s monetary policy at work. As more households renew their mortgage at a higher rate, it puts downward pressure on spending. They have less money available to spend on other things, that dampens demand, that sort of gets the economy back in balance,” said Rogers. </p><p>“We are watching for the financial pressure that comes with that. We usually talk about that more in our Financial System Review — we've got an update to that coming in November and you'll hear more from us on that at that point.”</p>","Thu, 26 Oct 2023 16:54:53 +0000"
65802581c7b44d3dfb1c5144,STOREYS,Report: Craving A Competitive Edge? ‘Cheque Out’ Of Paper Payments,"<img src=""https://storeys.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=49468476&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C31%2C0%2C31"" /><br /><br /><p>Pagers, fax machines, brick-like mobile phones — these things may have their nostalgic charms, but for many businesses they are tools of the past. Another item in this category? Cheque payments.</p><p>For decades, cheques have been one of the primary ways for property managers across Canada to process payments. But, just as many sectors are embracing tech and the digital world, so too is real estate.</p><p>In fact, the rise of PropTech (property technology) has been particularly rapid over the last several years, and the integration between real estate and technology is only expected to deepen in those to come. According to a <a href=""https://storeys.ubpages.com/interac-etransfer-for-business-lp/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">new report from Interac</a>, approximately six out of 10 Canadian-based business decision makers surveyed — from across multiple industries — believe cheques are an outdated method of payment. And it makes sense; customers and vendors have come to expect the convenience of digital. In fact, the report says, 74% of companies polled anticipate they’ll phase out cheques entirely within the next five years.</p><p>“This is a significant move that will completely change how payments are made,” reads the report. It goes on to highlight the importance of property managers maintaining a competitive advantage via “seamless operations, tenant satisfaction, and frequent maintenance.” Of course, none of these can be facilitated without more streamlined and efficient financial operations.</p><p>There's an appetite for change, and financial decision makers know it.</p><p>This new Interac report also introduces <em>Interac </em>e-Transfer® for Business as a solution property managers can incorporate — one that covers some of the fundamentals of their money-related needs.</p><div class=""rm-embed embed-media""><div id=""om-b8echswx4fdppyfdhnib-holder""></div></div><h3>Safe, Speedy, and Transparent</h3><p>First and foremost, <em>Interac </em>e-Transfer for Business provides a safe and secure way for property managers to, well, <em>manage</em> many of their financial transactions, as well as the systems surrounding them. Per the Interac report, the payments system is equipped with security features that help safeguard financial information. Think: advanced encryption and authentication methods, which minimize the risk of fraud and unauthorized access to payment data, unlike cheques.</p><p>What’s more, when money’s involved, there’s safety in speed. Cheques can take time to transport. Every time they move from one location to another, there’s a risk they could be lost and, ultimately, won’t get to where they’re supposed to go. These stresses can be mitigated with <em>Interac </em>e-Transfer® for Business.</p><p>Online payments also boast transparency; real-time deposits, immediate payment confirmation, and the ability to monitor payment status, for example. The Interac report explains that increased transparency means trust-building between partners, vendors, and customers, while risk of payment disputes or errors are reduced. </p><h3>Efficient and Easy</h3><p>When property managers embrace <em>Interac </em>e-Transfer for Business, their payment workflows are streamlined from paper-based practices to digital ones. This helps to reduce processing time and paperwork-related delays. Automated systems — complete with accounting software and global payment standard accommodations — make reconciliation and financial reporting simpler, all while reducing the risk of human error.</p><p>Paper-forward payments also involve manual tasks: printing, mailing, and auditing recipient details. These can be time-consuming and, once again, open an opportunity for error. Luckily, back-end payment processes can be modernized and simplified through digital solutions, resulting in increased speed and convenience (while reducing administrative burden).</p><p>The ultimate result is three-fold in savings: property managers’ attention, property managers’ energy, and, of course, cost.</p><h3>Cost-Effective</h3><p>“A common motto in business is that time is money,” reads the Interac report. Indeed, the cost of producing, printing, and distributing cheques can add up over time. Implementation of <em>Interac </em>e-Transfer for Business can help decrease these costs.</p><p>This means property managers can reallocate more resources towards growth, research and development, and improving the bottom line.</p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>If the rise of PropTech, the prevalence of the Internet Of Things, and the ability to buy a coffee by tapping your phone to a payment terminal are any indication, the days of cheques may be already behind us.</p><p>Today's property management professionals are navigating an evolving landscape, marked by shifting tenant preferences and tech advancements. Thus, they must be proactive in considering modernizing financial practices. <em>Interac </em>e-Transfer for Business invites property management companies to align with contemporary expectations, enhance the experiences of tenants and owners alike, and position themselves as industry leaders committed to embracing innovation for sustainable growth.</p><p>For property managers who want to stay more competitive in a fast- and ever-evolving industry, modernized payment methods are an integral part of the process.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><em>To learn more about Interac </em>e-Transfer for Business<em>, including how to make the switch, </em><a href=""https://storeys.ubpages.com/interac-etransfer-for-business-lp/"" target=""_blank""><em>read the Interac report in full here.</em></a><br /></p><p><em>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</em></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><em>This article was produced in partnership with </em><a href=""https://storeys.com/advertise-with-us/"" target=""_self""><em>STOREYS Custom Studio.</em></a></p>","Thu, 26 Oct 2023 16:25:09 +0000"

For borrowers whose mortgage will renew in the next 18 months, that number gets even larger, jumping to 74%.</p><p>Those concerned about renewing say they've considered extending the amortization periods (24%), switching to another lender (23%), extending their next mortgage term (18%), and selling their home to buy a smaller property to reduce their mortgage (17%).</p><p>Although these numbers are concerning, Karen Yolevski, Chief Operating Officer of Royal LePage, notes that, historically, ""Canadians by and large prioritize paying their mortgages.""</p><p>""When we look at mortgage default rates, they are so low in Canada — less than half a percent of mortgages end up in default — so people renewing their mortgage now or perhaps in the next six months, they're going to be paying a higher rate likely than they were paying before but we know that Canadians are going to prioritize spending on items that are needs versus wants, and housing being the highest in terms of that need in people's everyday life,"" Yolevski tells STOREYS. </p><p>Even still, the full impact of renewals is hard to measure at this point, with a vast majority of mortgages — 75% — being fixed rate.</p><p>""When we talk about rising interest rates, it's really interesting that [...] those that are still within their term of a fixed rate mortgage, they haven't been impacted by the rate hikes we've been seeing whatsoever,"" Yolevski said. </p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"">\n<img alt=""mortgages"" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""9425b"" src=""https://storeys.com/media-library/mortgages.jpg?id=50305014&amp;width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;quality=90&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"" />\n<small class=""image-media media-caption""> Royal LePage COO Karen Yolevski</small></p><p>Borrowers who bought a home during the first few years of the pandemic were able to lock in historically low interest rates, often below 2%. Now, they're facing rates around 6%. </p><p>Interestingly, the survey found that mortgage holders in what are typically more affordable provinces were more concerned about renewals than mortgage holders in the most expensive provinces. In Alberta, 82% of borrowers with a renewing mortgage reported being concerned, meanwhile in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, that number was 72%. In Ontario and BC, it was a bit lower, at 66% and 68%, respectively. Although the survey didn't address why this is, Yolevski says the reason can be speculated.</p><p>""We know that people that work in major urban centers typically will have a higher salary than those that are working in secondary markets that are driven by the cost of living in those bigger communities versus those smaller communities,"" she said. ""So potentially one of those reasons is the fact that from a salary perspective, people may have concerns that they're just not making enough money to pay at a higher interest rate.""</p><p>Yolevski also points to a psychological aspect that's at play.</p><p>""I think not to be discounted is the idea that people are hearing a lot about interest rates and the affordability of homes because of interest rates in the market right now,"" she said. ""It's certainly a hot topic. We talk about it a lot, and in cases like that, we encourage people to reach out to their financial institution if they have concerns, reach out to a mortgage professional, and really understand the impact of that.""</p><p>Amongst those concerned about renewing, 32% have considered selling their home, either to buy a smaller property (17%), rent instead (8%), or move in with family or friends (7%). But as for what's playing out in real time, Yolevski says she has yet to see a meaningful influx of sellers listing their homes because they can't afford the mortgage. </p><p>""It's a question that has been asked a number of times in the last few weeks and we are not seeing an increase in forced sales,"" Yolevski notes. ""There are certainly outlier stories, and we've seen that in the media and heard personal accounts of that, so that is something that is out there on a case-by-case basis.""</p>","Thu, 26 Oct 2023 07:30:02 +0000"

We are currently in the midst of the most rapid hike cycle in BoC history, and there are a lot of moving parts. For some context, here’s a look back on the rate decisions that have brought Canadian housing to such an unprecedented point in time.</p><h3>March 2, 2022: BoC Kicks Off Hike Cycle, Raises Policy Rate To 0.5%</h3><p>In March of last year, the bank put an end to the ultra-low rates that characterized the pandemic era by increasing its overnight lending rate by 25 basis points to 0.50%, citing “elevated” housing market activity as one of the motivating factors for this initial hike. </p><p>In the immediate aftermath, the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) reported that March saw a ‘definite slowdown’ in sales activity (down 5.4% month over month), following a surge observed in February 2022. While around two-thirds of local markets were in sellers’ markets territory at that time, CREA noted that the remainder had entered into balanced market territory.</p><h3>April 13, 2022: BoC “Begins Quantitative Tightening,” Raises Rate To 1%</h3><p>The BoC opted for an increase of 50 basis points in April of last year, noting at the time that they were ‘ending reinvestment and beginning quantitative tightening.’</p><p>That month, CREA reported that national home sales slipped close to 13% month over month as mortgage rates “shot higher.” This drop in sales put monthly activity at the lowest level since the summer of 2020. By this time, a little more than half of local markets had entered into balanced market territory. The following month, in May 2022, Canadian home sales fell an additional 8.6% (month over month).</p><h3>June 1, 2022: BoC Raises Rate To 1.5%</h3><p>An increase of 50 basis points brought the rate to 1.50% in June of last year. This followed a stronger-than-anticipated inflation jump of 6.8% in April. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, Canadian home sales saw another dip in June, dropping 5.6% on a month-over-month basis, according to CREA. CREA also noted at the time that monthly activity was “slightly below average” for the month of June and that nearly three-quarters of local markets were balanced market territory.</p><h3>July 13, 2022: BoC Raises Rate To 2.5%</h3><p>In the height of summer, and despite an obvious pullback in home sales, the BoC tacked another 100 basis points to its policy rate, bringing it to 2.5%. </p><p>CREA noted at the time that, while demand was still there, many would-be homebuyers were opting for a ‘wait and see’ approach amid the escalating cost of borrowing. As such, July 2022 saw national home sales slip 5.3% month over month. As well, said CREA, sales were down in about three-quarters of all local markets, led by the Greater Toronto Area, Greater Vancouver, the Fraser Valley, Calgary, and Edmonton.</p><p>While sales continued to edge down in August, activity slipped only nominally (down 1% on a month-over-month basis), which (former) CREA Chair Jill Oudil noted “could be an early sign that this year’s sharp adjustment in housing markets across Canada may have mostly run its course.”</p><h3>September 7, 2022: BoC Raises Rate To 14-Year High Of 3.25% </h3><p>September of last year brought yet another rate hike from the BoC — a 75-basis-point increase that landed the rate at 3.25% (a 14-year high). Despite what seemed like less weakness from the housing market in August, the bank said at the time that higher mortgage rates were working as anticipated: by slowing the housing market “following unsustainable growth during the pandemic.”</p><p>Fall 2022 then kicked off with a 3.9% dip in home sales (between August and September), marking “a slight increase in the current sales slowdown that began with the Bank of Canada’s first rate hike back in March,” according to CREA. As well, the national sales-to-new listings ratio (SNLR) eased to 52% (down from 53.6% in August), putting it deeper into balanced territory.</p><h3>October 26, 2022: BoC Raises Rate To 3.75%</h3><p>The BoC opted for another hike in October 2022. This time around, an increase of 50 basis points brought the rate to 3.75%. “The effects of recent policy rate increases by the bank are becoming evident in interest-sensitive areas of the economy,” said the bank at the time, pointing to the fact that housing activity had “retreated sharply.”</p><p>Even so, CREA reported that Canadian home sales actually increased (by 1.3%) between September and October. This was the first monthly gain since February. As well, said CREA, about 60% of all local markets saw positive sales activity in the month, with Greater Vancouver leading the way. </p><p>However, in November, sales returned to a downward trend, slipping 3.3% month over month. CREA Senior Economist Shaun Cathcart said at the time that November was a “quiet” month for Canadian housing and cautioned that the winter would be similarly downcast thanks to the BoC’s October interest rate hike.</p><h3>December 7, 2022: BoC Raises Rate to 4.25%</h3><p>Despite still-elevated inflation, the BoC capped off the calendar year with a sixth straight interest rate hike: a 50-basis-point raise that brought the rate to 4.25% in December 2022.</p><p>That same month, national home sales managed a 1.3% month-over-month jump, according to CREA, while the SNLR rose to 54.4% (up from 50.2% in November), bringing it closer to sellers’ territory. Oudil noted at the time that “the market’s adjustment to higher rates may be mostly in the rear-view mirror at this point.” She added that CREA anticipated spring would “bring buyers back off the sidelines.”</p><p>However, 2023 started off at a low point, with Canadian home sales slipping 3% month over month in January. The year-over-year sales metric came in at a 14-year low. Cathcart, at the time, likened early 2023 to 2019, “where after a year in which it became much harder to qualify for a mortgage, everyone was wondering if the market would pick up in the spring.”</p><h3>January 25, 2023: BoC Rings In New Year With Hike, Raises Rate to 4.5%<br /></h3><p>The new year brought worsened interest rate realities for Canadians, with the BoC raising the rate once again by 25 basis points to 4.50% near the end of January. However, they signalled that rates were close to their ceiling as CPI was expected to dip to 3% by mid-year. </p><p>Despite the hike, February 2023 saw a 2.3% month-over-month uptick in Canadian home sales, with the most significant gains recorded in the GTA and Greater Vancouver. Oudil, at the time, forecasted a “more robust market to come.”</p><h3>March 8 & April 13, 2023: BoC Holds Rate At 4.5%</h3><p>At long last, March of this year brought the first rate pause of the cycle, with the BoC opting to maintain the rate at 4.50%. This move, in part, was brought on by “flat” economic growth and easing inflation. The BoC saw the pause through to April’s decision as well.</p><p>During that time, Canadian housing rallied considerably. In March, national home sales rose 1.4% month over month in March. In April, they “surged” another 11.3%. In May, they jumped up another 5.1%. During these three months, SNLR swung above 60%, marking sellers’ market conditions. </p><p>“With interest rates at a top, and home prices at a bottom, it wasn’t all that surprising to see buyers jumping off the sidelines and back into the market in April,” said Cathcart in April. </p><h3>June 7 2023: BoC Commences Hikes, Raises Rate To 4.75%<br /></h3><p>Alas, all good things must come to an end. In June of this year, the BoC went for a hike of 25 basis points, bringing the rate to 4.75%, citing stronger-than-anticipated GDP and the first inflation uptick (in April) in 10 months. </p><p>That same month, CREA reported that Canadian home sales — which edged up only 1.5% month over month — were showing signs of “stabilizing.” While one assumption could be that the hike had an imminent impact on buyer mentality, Larry Cerqua, Chair of CREA, also pointed out a “recovery in new listings,” which helped to satiate demand. </p><p>As well, CREA reported that the SNLR came in at 63.6% in June, easing 66.4% in May and continuing to point to sellers’ market conditions.</p><h3>July 12, 2023: BoC Brings Rate To 22-Year High</h3><p>July marked another BoC rate increase — this time a 25-basis-point hike brought the rate to a 22-year high of 5%. Not surprisingly, the bank attributed this move (in part) to “some pickup” in the housing market. </p><p>The back-to-back rate hikes over the summer pushed Canadian home sales down 0.7% month over month in June, according to CREA, while the SNLR eased to 59.2% in the month as well, which, technically, brought the market back into balanced territory. </p><p>The downcast narrative continued in August, with national home sales sliding another 4.1% month over month. ""August was the first full month of housing data following the Bank of Canada’s July rate hike, so a dip in activity was expected,” noted Cathcart at the time.</p><h3>September 6, 2023: BoC Holds Rate At 5%</h3><p>And that brings us to September. Just last month, the BoC opted for another rate hold, citing the slowing Canadian economy. Even so, the bank indicated that there’s no ruling out further rate hikes at this stage in the game. </p><p>National home sales continued to pull back in the month, with CREA reporting a month-over-month dip of 1.9% in September 2023. Meanwhile, the SNLR eased to 51.4% (an unmistakable place of balance). However, some individual markets tipped into buyers’ territory last month. In Toronto, for instance, the SNLR slipped below 30% in the month, putting it firmly in a <a href=""https://storeys.com/toronto-real-estate-buyers-market/"" target=""_self"">buyers’ market</a>. </p><p><em>The BoC’s next interest rate decision is scheduled for tomorrow — Wednesday, October 25, 2023 — at 10:00 a.m.</em></p>","Tue, 24 Oct 2023 17:53:34 +0000"

Sponsored by the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board, the Federation of Rental-housing Providers of Ontario, and STOREYS, the event gave more than a dozen real estate sector stakeholders from across the province an opportunity to speak freely about the housing crisis, including how we can start to solve it. </p><p>Speakers and presenters included everyone from bureaucratic bigwigs, like Premier Doug Ford and Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow, to market specialists like TRREB’s Jason Mercer, Altus’ Marlon Bray, and Smart Prosperity Institute’s Mike Moffatt, amongst others. </p><p>“We are at the crossroads of a generational crisis in housing, however, it’s unprecedented,” RESCON president, Richard Lyall, said to attendees in his opening remarks. </p><p>“There is little value in assessing blame and pointing fingers at this stage or at various levels. Our responsibility must be focussed on solutions. All levels of government, all private sector partners, and all housing stakeholders have a role to play.”</p><h3>A Better Approach To Policy Reform</h3><p>In speaking to housing-related policy and tax reforms implemented by governments to date, Marlon Bray, head of Altus Group's Ontario pre-construction and contract administration services, said that, at best, the measures we’ve seen advanced have been “haphazard” and “reactionary.” </p><p>“Right now, we’re wasting everybody’s time, and quite frankly, the housing crisis is not going to get solved where we are today or [with] anything that’s been proposed. We’re nibbling at the edges,” said Bray. </p><p>Something like the fed’s GST rebate “will move the market to a degree,” noted Bray, but it’s not enough.</p><p>Instead, Bray calls for more coordinated and thoughtful approaches to policy reform — one that’s sympathetic to the way the private development sector actually operates — and suggests other, more assertive measures, such as development charge rebates and property tax deferrals. </p><h3>A Plea For The Feds To Step Up</h3><p>Mayor Chow spoke during the mayors' panel portion of the summit about the importance of public infrastructure, stressing that there’s plenty of room for improvement with respect to how infrastructure is funded within municipalities. </p><p>The current system in place in Toronto, where infrastructure is funded entirely by property taxes, means that the city is limited with respect to investments in things like transit. </p><p>“What does that have to do with building housing? Well, a whole lot, because we can’t manage the housing if we don’t have the infrastructure, including transit,” said Chow. “A liveable city is not just building. It’s building things around it that makes the people that move in very happy.”</p><p>Chow’s sentiments surrounding public infrastructure were echoed by Paul Smetanin, President and CEO of the Canadian Centre for Economic Analysis, who spoke in depth about the role of other levels of government in dictating the housing status quo within municipalities. </p><p>“We live in a country that doesn’t really believe in investing in infrastructure, or having an organized plan around infrastructure,” Smetanin said, pointing out that public infrastructure investment funding is currently 30% below where it should be to properly support growth. </p><p>In order to “promote sustainable economic growth” across Ontario, Smetanin said the federal government needs to “address imbalances” brought on by rampant population growth and ambitious immigration targets. </p><p>This means increasing their investments into public infrastructure, for one, but also taking stock of things like tax burdens and profit structures, both of which currently swing in favour of government fees and levies and do little in the way of incentivizing developers to build. </p><h3>Taking A Cue From The Past For PBRs</h3><p>Capping off the presentation portion of the summit was Smart Prosperity Institute’s Mike Moffatt, who suggested that the current tax system is “very poorly designed” when it comes to housing — and particularly when it comes to purpose-built rental development.</p><p>Purpose-built rentals tend to serve low-income end-users and are typically more environmentally friendly than single-dwelling homes, noted Moffatt. “That would suggest the tax system should have a fairly light touch on taxing lower-income apartment dwellers, apartment renters.”</p><p>But on the contrary, high- and low-rise rentals tend to be taxed more heavily (on a square footage basis) than any other type of residential development in Toronto and across Ontario.</p><p>“Our tax system works against building the kinds of housing forms that we need, against building communities that help low-income renters, against our environment goals,” said Moffatt. </p><p>At one point, there was a system in place that was actually productive. Prior to 1972, Canada had an “accelerated capital cost allowance” (ACCA) of 10% for apartment buildings, which served to lower the cost factor for apartment projects, as well as the associated tax obligation. </p><p>At that time, there was another policy in place that allowed building owners to defer the capital gains taxes on selling a building, so long as they reinvested the profits into building more purpose rentals. </p><p>“It created a virtuous cycle, where the 10% ACCA creates the incentive to build a building, the deferral provisions created an incentive to sell the building and then build a new one,” said Moffatt. “It’s not a coincidence that we were building a lot more apartment buildings in the ‘60s and ‘70s with these kinds of provisions than we do today.”</p><p>It’s worth noting that bringing back such a framework would cost all levels of government around 2.2B over five years. </p><p>“This would cost the federal government some money, it would cost the province some money as well,” said Moffatt. “But the amount of new construction that we can unlock with this one simple tax change — that again, was a system that we had up until 50 years ago — is worth the investment.”</p><p><em>The full RESCON Housing Summit 3.0 can be viewed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uogOvhShAds&amp;ab_channel=ResidentialConstructionCouncilofOntario%28RESCON%29"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</em></p>","Fri, 13 Oct 2023 21:42:01 +0000"

Still, council has affirmed that the ultimate goal of the Vacant Home Tax is to discourage speculators and “collect zero dollars.”</p><p>“No one should be keeping a home empty during this housing crisis,” Chow also said.</p><p>The increase to the tax rate — it will go into effect for the 2024 tax year — was just one of a number of recommended changes to the tax <a href=""https://storeys.com/toronto-vacant-home-tax/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_self"">adopted by the Executive Committee </a>earlier this month. </p><p>Council voted almost unanimously on Wednesday to direct additional revenues from the 2023 Vacant Home Tax to the Multi-Unit Residential Acquisition program, through which not-for-profit housing providers can access funding to preserve existing affordable rental housing stock across the city. Only Councillor Stephen Holyday was in opposition of the changes. </p><p>A number of other motions were also carried, including one from Councillor Paula Fletcher that will require short-term rental units occupied for 28 consecutive days or longer without a lease in place to be subject to the Vacant Home Tax, a two-year exemption from the tax in cases where a property owner has passed away in the reference taxation year, and a three-year exemption from the tax following the death of the property owner in a taxation year.</p><p>According to a report from the Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, 2,161 properties have been declared vacant in Toronto as of August 1, 2023, while 17,437 have been deemed vacant.</p><p>That latter figure is down compared to February 2022, notes the report, as more declarations were received through the Notice of Complaint process, and is on track to decrease further as more declarations come in.</p><p>Although actual revenues generated by the tax “will not be finalized until all Notice of Complaints and audits for the taxation year is complete,” the report reveals that the City has already collected $54M in Vacant Home Tax revenue to date, “which is consistent with the estimated and budgeted revenues for 2023.”</p>","Thu, 12 Oct 2023 14:27:50 +0000"

As for those with hopes to buy, the national agency speculates that young people simply aren't in good purchasing shape amid “affordability concerns.”</p><p>“If you're a first-time or younger buyer and you're saving for a downpayment, that's a lot of money to come up with regardless,” says Karen Yolevski, Chief Operating Officer for Royal LePage’s Corporate Brokerages.</p><p>And then there's inflation and the interest rate environment to consider, she adds — not to mention, home prices, which Yolevski estimates have risen by around 120% in the past 10 years. </p><p>“That’s going to impact how much young people have to save for a down payment and it's going to impact qualification for a mortgage. Certainly, people have seen wage increases and they may have had job mobility, but has that matched the increase in the pricing of homes? No, it has not.”<br /></p><p>Despite the uphill trajectory of home prices and borrowing conditions that have gotten more and more challenging with every interest rate hike, young people are “keen” to break into homeownership, says Yolevski, and they’re exploring more inventive ways to do so.</p><p>She points to a recent Royal LePage <a href=""https://storeys.com/canadian-housing-market-co-ownership/"" target=""_self"">survey</a> that digs into co-homeownership amongst Canadians. While Yolevski says that co-owning a home is “certainly not a new trend,” she also notes that the number of young people citing affordability as their “number one reason” for co-owning with friends, family, spouses, and even acquaintances is on the rise. </p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"">\n<img alt=""canada housing market"" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""589f0"" src=""https://storeys.com/media-library/canada-housing-market.png?id=49442448&amp;width=980"" />\n<small class=""image-media media-caption"">Royal LePage asked current co-owners if affordability was “a major motivating factor” the decision to purchase a home collaboratively</small></p><p>“What we're seeing is creativity from people who are saying, 'If I can't do this on my own, perhaps I can get some help.' So we’re seeing parents helping younger people to get into the market, we're also seeing siblings buying together to a lesser extent and we're seeing friends buying together as well,” says Yolevski.</p><p>That’s not to say young people are necessarily shacking up, Yolevski adds. </p><p>“It kind of falls into the transfer of wealth phenomenon that we know is coming in Canada,” she says. “There is a tremendous amount of wealth in the boomer generation, and in the generation above that even, that will be transferred through estates and gifts over the next number of years. And that has an impact on housing because a number of people are using those gifts to invest in housing.”</p><p>In short, says Yolevski, the dream of homeownership amongst Young Canadians isn’t dead — it is, however, limbo. </p><p>“What we may see more of is people looking at what we would call the secondary markets, where homes are more affordable. And we may see more young people leading a migration movement into other provinces in Canada where they have more affordability,” she says. </p>","Wed, 11 Oct 2023 19:30:18 +0000"

If approved by Council, the fee would be effective for the 2023 Taxation Year and subject to an annual automatic inflationary adjustment.</p><p>Tuesday’s recommendations are accompanied by a report from the Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, which reveals that, as of August 1, 2023, 2,161 properties have been declared vacant while 17,437 have been deemed vacant. </p><p>That latter figure is down compared to February 2022 as more declarations were received through the Notice of Complaint process, notes the report, and is on track to decrease further as more declarations come in. </p><p>“As such, actual revenues generated by [the Vacant Home Tax] will not be finalized until all Notice of Complaints and audits for the taxation year is complete.”</p><p>In the meantime, the City has collected $54M in Vacant Home Tax revenue, “which is consistent with the estimated and budgeted revenues for 2023.”</p><p>The Executive Committee’s recommendations and the Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer’s report are set to go before City Council on October 3, 2023. </p>","Wed, 04 Oct 2023 16:10:37 +0000"
