LangChain enables modular and flexible AI architectures which provides unique advantages:

- Model I/O: Interface for communication with language models.

- Data Connection: Interface with application-specific data.

- Chains: Sequences of calls that represent tasks.

- Agents: Let chains decide which tools to use.

- Memory: Maintains application state between chain runs.

- Callbacks: Logs and streams intermediate steps of chains.
